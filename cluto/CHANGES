Changes in 2.1.1
  - Fixed problems with the postscript output driver and newer versions
    of ghostscript.
  - Fixed problems with incorrect bitmap sizes for gif output format.
  - Fixed various font problems with the xfig output format.
  - Fixed a bug associated with incorrectly computing the similarities
    in the hierarchical tree files.
  - Corrected the ISIM values reported by the scluster program. 
  - Fixed a bug in -showsummaries=itemsets.
  - Corrected the information displayed during -help for -showsummaries.
  - Reduced the memory requirements of the rb-based clustering methods.

Changes in 2.1.0
  - Added a -showsummaries option for analyzing the co-occurrence
    of the key features within the objects of each cluster.
  - Added an agglomerative algorithm that uses partitional-clustering
    to bias the agglomeration.
  - Added similarity function based on extended Jackard coefficient 
    for graphs.
  - Added a cluster-selection method for repeated bisecting clustering
    that is based on the cardinality of the cluster's sub-space.
  - Streamlined some of the parameters of vcluster & scluster.
  - Fixed a major bug with Euclidean distance calculations on sparse
    datasets.

Changes in 2.0.0
  - The new clustering programs are now called vcluster & scluster
  - Added graph-partitioning based clustering algorithms
  - Expanded all algorithms to operate on the object-to-object
    similarity graph.
  - Added -agglofrom and -agglocrfun functionality for hybrid
    clustering
  - Fixed many bugs

Changes in 1.5.1a
  - Fixed an improperly linked vacluster binary for Win32 platforms.

Changes in 1.5.1
  - Fixed some bugs associated with the -fulltree option and the 
    CLUTO_V_BuildTree routine. 

Changes in 1.5.0
  - Added a set of fully functional agglomerative clustering
    algorithms.
  - Added support for hybrid partitional and agglomerative 
    clustering.
  - Added an extensive set of cluster visualization capabilities.
  - Added support for correlation coefficient based similarities.
  - Added support for dense input files.
