The two bombers who carried out Friday s attack which led the Israeli Cabinet to suspend deliberations on the land for security accord signed with the Palestinians last month were identified as members of Islamic Holy War from West Bank villages under Israeli security control
Palestinian political leaders said Israel should not use Friday s suicide bombing which killed the two assailants and wounded Israelis as an excuse to stop the peace process
One of Israel s key demands is that the Palestinians do more to fight attacks by Islamic militants against Israeli targets
Israel said it showed Arafat s crackdown on terrorists had not been sweeping enough
