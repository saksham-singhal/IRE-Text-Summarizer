When the media horde closed in however the third year forward went to look for his late arriving teammates inside the practice facility$0
Both sides agree that it would take at least three weeks to hold abbreviated training camps and sign over free agents to new contracts$1
Both sides reluctantly hammered out a deal in before the start of training camp with the sole notion of not missing games and preserving the NBA s perfect record$1

But we recognize that beyond a certain point we can t possibly sell to our fans that we re having an NBA season$1
But we would want him to have the right for him to work temporarily until he could come back and honor his contract Russ Granik NBA deputy commissioner said the league has approved the idea of players earning a living elsewhere until the lockout is settled$1
He also discussed the possibility of a significantly shortened season$1
Hurdles could be overcome very quickly but I have no reason to believe they will on Thursday Granik said$1
I don t think we should get too carried away about the possibilities just yet Granik said$1
Monday in cities throughout the country the players are holding make shift press conferences at training camp venues NBA arenas and gymnasiums$1
Neither side is predicting progress toward signing a new collective bargaining agreement and beginning the season as scheduled on Nov$1
On the day when training camps were scheduled to begin players from across the country held news conferences in NBA cities to proclaim themselves ready to practice for the regular season$1
Privately officials on both sides do not believe the season will start as scheduled on Nov$1
Since we re not even negotiating you have to conclude it s very likely that we re going miss some part of the regular season deputy commissioner Russ Granik said Monday night$1
Taking into account that a three to four week period would be needed for training camp and free agent signings before the season starts the league said it would decide in two weeks whether to make further cancellations$1

Thursday s bargaining session has suddenly become the last hope at starting the season on time$1
Today is supposed to be the start of training camp$1
We have a few months before we have to face that decision Perhaps the only progress involved Thursday in the conference room of a midtown Manhattan hotel was a question and answer session over the league s latest proposal to the players$1

Added Hunter Of course they don t expect much to get done$2
And here it is some of the workers not the management who are considering trying to make the union disappear$2
At one point before the two parties broke for lunch Stern and Hunter raised their voices and accused each other of handling their constituencies poorly a participant in the meeting said$2
Billy Hunter the union s executive director offered a glimmer of hope$2
Billy Hunter the union s executive director warned the owners this week that a prolonged lockout could destroy the league s popularity$2
But the two were seen shaking hands and laughing after the meeting concluded shortly after pm There was some venting from both sides Hunter said$2
He spoke optimistically about the potential for a quick resolution$2
I consider it to be a collective failure but I honestly don t know what else we could have done$2
I consider it to be a collective failure but I honestly don t know what else we could have done$2
I don t know if this is going to come to a speedy resolution Ewing said$2
I don t think they re too concerned at this point about making a deal$2
I m not at all concerned Hunter said$2
I m not going to try and put it in dollars and cents But Ewing president of the National Basketball Association Players Association played the public relations game Tuesday by expounding on the themes of labor unrest strong willed unity and short sighted proposals$2
If he rules in our favor I think it emboldens the spirit and the resolve of the players said Billy Hunter union executive director$2
If we win I think it just emboldens the spirit and resolve of the players union director Billy Hunter said$2
If we win I think it just emboldens the spirit and resolve of the players union director Billy Hunter said$2
It s like they want to see how strong we are Ewing said$2
Neither Granik nor players association executive director Billy Hunter sounded as if this week s meeting would go a long way toward the signing of a new agreement the precursor to playing again$2
Patrick Ewing did not want to sound like a striking longshoreman demanding health benefits$2
Patrick Ewing the union president and several teammates will speak at SUNY Purchase in Purchase NY where the Knicks train during the season$2

Standing a few feet away from Ewing he said I hope the owners and commissioner have gotten the message that we re serious about a deal$2
The league also called former union director Simon Gourdine to testify$2
Unfortunately the union leadership has been unwilling to give any serious consideration to what we have offered Hunter labeled those claims as optimistic projections and shot down a number of new proposals presented to the players on Sept$2
We re buoyed by the fact for the first time they ve decided to submit a counterproposal the union s executive director Billy Hunter said$2

We want to show the public that we as players want to play said Ewing who was flanked by five teammates$2
We would have to be stupid and ignorant to accept that deal Said Hunter If you go for their proposal it s just a joke$2
When there was no shot to take he invented a new one$2
in any circumstance Hunter said$2

Still a five hour meeting that was described as cordial by the league and almost like two bulls letting off a little steam by the players association produced another scheduled round of talks next Tuesday$20
Today we took the coats off and we were inclined to take the gloves off a little bit$20
When they explored the idea of a tax system we were taking the players at their word that they wanted to make some headway$21
A lot of people in Boston told me that they had followed me from the time they were very young to when they were in college The Bird years numbered only three Celtics championships but he was the best player pro basketball s most famous team ever had$22
A rare Bird an honest exception to the rule$22
And that is where we stand as this onetime exception has become the very expensive rule the owners don t want to play by anymore$22
Big stars get millions while most get union scale$22
But Michael Jordan made million$22
But if and when the owners decide they want a deal then they ll get one But soon after he began lambasting the owners latest proposal which includes the eventual phasing out of the Larry Bird exception the clause that enables free agents to earn unlimited salaries from their current teams$22
Called the Larry Bird exception it was created to allow the Hall of Fame Boston Celtics forward to re sign with the Celtics near the end of his career$22
Currently the rookie scale is three years and includes a clause that enables a player to exercise his Bird rights after two seasons a clause Kevin Garnett parlayed into an astronomical million deal last year with Minnesota$22

Deservedly enshrined as forever exceptional he again becomes Bird the exception the case study for a contentious and potentially disastrous labor war$22
For example if a player made million the team would be forced to put million into a fund that would most likely be distributed to low revenue teams$22

I can understand both sides said Bird safely in the middle between Bird the former exception and Bird the present Indiana Pacers coach$22
I know at the time I was very happy about it That would have been when the Celtics wanted to compensate Bird with a million bonus to push through his back pain go on as their savior$22
I think it would be a case by case basis but yes there s already some people talking about that said Bill Strickland a member of the union s agents advisory committee$22
If Larry and Magic hadn t done what they did we might not survive what we re about to go through said Bill Fitch Bird s first Celtics coach who with Bill Walton stood with him on the night that he said gave closure to his playing career$22
It wasn t about hype about money That is not quite the case nor should it have been$22
Larry Bird in the Indiana countryside or inside Boston Garden was a luminous exception to the governing rule$22
Michael Jordan exercised the clause the last two years with the Chicago Bulls earning more than million per season figures more than million more what a team is allowed to spend on all its players$22
No not really Bird said when I asked whether he is troubled by the likelihood of his legendary name soon representing a symbol of greed to unsympathetic millions$22
Teams would get a right of first refusal on free agents after the fourth year for incoming rookies meaning a player would be contractually obligated to the same team for the first four years of his deal$22
Teams would get a right of first refusal on free agents after the fourth year for incoming rookies meaning a player would be contractually obligated to the same team for the first four years of his deal$22
That s how Larry and Magic played always dreaming of the special team$22
The NBA of Michael Jordan reached greater heights than anyone imagined it could but it is a league that now suffers from a sickness of the soul$22
The courts could reject a union decertification vote as a sham and in any case some players may fear that teams would feel free to offer less than the old union minimum$22
The current arrangement has produced an unbalanced pay scale of immense proportions$22
The main points were as follows A percent tax would be imposed on salary earned above million a clause that would affect only a few players who exercised their Bird rights$22

The number of players making million to million a year the middle class in NBA terms fell sharply$22
The process of unsealing the cap to re sign a particular player eventually became known as making use of the Larry Bird exception$22
The union says it is worried about that middle class but seems determined to preserve the free market$22
The union used the existence of that clause to argue that all the other teams should have protected themselves similarly$22
The union used the existence of that clause to argue that all the other teams should have protected themselves similarly$22
They stood for the pass for team play but now their decade of selflessness has given way to one of selfishness$22
Though many economic issues need to be resolved the main point of contention since the labor agreement expired and the owners declared a lockout on July has been a clause which allows teams to pay their own free agents whatever they want regardless of salary cap rules governing the NBA s teams$22
Through tickets sales alone Granik estimated that losing the exhibition season would cost the league between million and million$22
We don t want to do anything that would encourage Chicago from getting Michael Jordan back$22

When that was adopted it was assumed that no team would pay a lot more than a rival could pay$22
While the players did not discuss the elimination of the Larry Bird exception a clause that allows a player to secure any amount of money he wants in re signing with his current team they did address the exception in their taxation proposal$22

Without getting into the exception I think it s very important for players to stay in the same place Important he meant for franchise stability and fan identification$22
You have a son who is years old he goes from to in the years you ve played Bird said$22
He hired the late Bob Woolf one of the original heavy hitting agents and got himself a record rookie contract$23
I believe that in any field there has to be an allowance for the truly special ones Walton said$24
He was the classic small town prodigy with the creativity of a big city profiteer$25
There s a perception that we re on strike$26
He added We re about as far apart as the Grand Canyon right now $27
If they had left the current deal in place we would have gotten much of that anyway he added$27
About players are expected to attend speak and sign autographs for fans afterward$28
But fan memories are relatively short and now baseball seems more popular than ever$28

Both sides are still awaiting the outcome of an arbitration decision that is due before Oct$4

A salary cap credit would go into effect if the league pays out more than percent of revenues in salary$5
A salary cap credit would go into effect if the league pays out more than percent of revenues in salary$5
Alan Greenspan I am sure would agree that this salary cap is convoluted enough to give anyone a headache so let s just say it is a cap that does not exist when a team is negotiating with one of its own$5
Also if the percent threshold is met a reduction of annual percent raises would take effect for multi year contracts$5
Also if the percent threshold is met a reduction of annual percent raises would take effect for multi year contracts$5
And we feel with a hard cap we as players cannot survive$5
As it stands that can t be the solution The owners goal is to slow the growth of player salaries in relation to leaguewide revenue over the next three years while the players want to keep earning as much as possible$5
But both sides have termed the figures in each other s proposal as unacceptable and it was unclear whether either side was willing compromise$5
But the players would have an assurance that the salary cap would go up at least million before the credit goes into effect$5
But the players would have an assurance that the salary cap would go up at least million before the credit goes into effect$5
But with exorbitant salaries paid to several unproven stars over the last few years and million deals sprouting up routinely the owners are determined to swing the income pendulum back toward themselves by enforcing a restricted salary cap a hard cap and putting a ceiling on how much one player could earn$5

In the current negotiation the league has offered to guarantee that its payroll will rise percent over the next four years from billion to billion and says it is open to proposals to split that money any way the players want whether by raising the minimum salary or guaranteeing raises for veterans$5
Last year the players received about billion dollars in salaries and benefits and we have made proposals that are guaranteed to increase that number by percent over the next four years Granik said in a prepared statement$5

The most important loophole in its salary cap lets a team sign its own free agent for whatever it is willing to pay$5
The owners say that figure is currently hovering around percent$5
The owners were allowed to terminate the current agreement because of a clause that enabled them to do so after player salaries reached percent of total basketball related income$5

A ruling for the union would be significant for all future negotiations between players and owners$6
After the players saw these proposals from the league and the recent posturing by NBA owners well I had two players call me up and tell me if need be they d be willing to hock everything they ve got Another significant development may be thedeparture of many players to Europe until the dispute is settled according to at least two player agents$6
But neither the players nor the owners are counting on the ruling by the arbitrator John Feerick to speed up negotiations especially if Feerick finds in favor of the players an award that could approach million in salaries$6
But we understand that won t end the lockout$6
He said it was his understanding when he negotiated the old labor agreement in that players would not be paid if the owners chose to reopen the agreement and impose a lockout$6
Hunter dismissed the league s latest proposal on Friday afternoon then said both sides would be best served by awaiting Feerick s ruling$6
Hunter dismissed the league s latest proposal on Friday afternoon then said both sides would be best served by awaiting Feerick s ruling$6
I cannot understand it$6
If Feerick finds in favor of the owners the reality of not being paid may spur the players to reach an agreement more quickly$6
If Feerick finds in favor of the players there will be no economic incentive for those with guaranteed contracts to reach an agreement quickly$6
If the intent was to reach an agreement at this late stage or to negotiate in earnest this was the wrong way to go about it League officials did not respond to the players comments$6
If the players win the ruling the NBA intends to renew its motion to disqualify Feerick$6
In fact I think the they ve intended it all along$6
The deterrent factor of a lockout is that employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement do not get paid once the agreement expires and they are unable to reach a new agreement$6
The league already has sued the players over Feerick s jurisdiction$6
