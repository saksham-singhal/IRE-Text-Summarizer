After hearing his admissions in a closed session Livingston s colleagues gave him a standing ovation of support and said the question of his resigning had never arisen$4
As they stood the Democrats sensed Livingston had most suddenly closed a trap on the president and his defenders$4

The longer they took the more numerous the call for resignation would probably be$4
The only way we can stop this vicious cycle Bonior cried out from the floor is if we refuse to give into it whether it is Bill Clinton or Bob Livingston But the House was still reeling through the frenzied day as the fateful vote on the presidency approached and the notion of resignation licked about the capital city like a flame in a forest$4

Even as the bombing continued in Iraq and Americans from coast to coast were clamoring for an alternative to impeachment even as his own adulterous past was being flushed out in the grotesque invasions of privacy that inevitably followed the relentlessly prurient pursuit of the president even as the country began to contemplate the destructive effects of a lengthy and bitter Senate trial the speaker designate arrogantly and stupidly proclaimed Let us disregard the outside influences The radicals on the Hill would hear nothing but the echoes of their own fanaticism$5
He urged the president to heal the wounds that you have created$5

One other president Andrew Johnson of Tennessee has been tried by the Senate of course$5
One transcendently important thing remains the same Although surrounded by judicial trappings and presided over by the chief justice trials of presidents are political processes with power residing in the hands of elective politicians$5

To my colleagues across the aisle I say let go of your obsession$5
What lies behind that seeming contradiction of course is the fear that Clinton and the country with him would be incapacitated$5

But even before the vote Republicans pressed another line of attack demanding Clinton s resignation$6
But the sense of history and decorum didn t last long at CBS$6
But while Clinton has focused on the polls and the CBS News survey showed that percent still approve of his handling of his job as president resignation could almost immediately subject him to criminal prosecution$6
Even before Saturday s epochal roll calls four of ten Americans interviewed in the latest New York Times CBS News Poll said they thought the president should step down if he were to be indicted despite the fact that a large majority voiced disapproval of the impeachment proceedings$6
Even on Friday night after a hour debate a CBS News Poll of people showed that only percent wanted their representative to vote for impeachment percent wanted a no vote$6
For only the second time in American history a president would be impeached went the standard line$6
He later announced impeachment votes on a split screen with the football game in progress in the upper part of the screen$6
I say we must draw a line between right and wrong not with a tiny fine line of an executive fountain pen but with the big fat lead of a No$6
In the end the will of the people meant nothing$6
Jerrold Nadler D NY We re lowering the standards of impeachment$6
Let us disregard the outside influences Let us disregard the people$6
Listen to the American people But the voices of reason would not be heard$6
McHugh announced on Tuesday that he would vote for impeachment$6
McHugh may have wished out loud for mercy but he clearly was too frightened of the right wingers in the House to cast a compassionate vote himself$6
No one took Andrew Johnson very seriously after he escaped conviction by a single vote$6
On the other networks and cable channels the vote itself literally happened in the background$6
Ordinary Americans could cry out all they wanted$6
Others thought the Republicans seeing dismal numbers in polls about their party s standing in the United States would be the first to blink$6
Party lines on Saturday s rolls calls held as firm as leg irons$6
President Nixon it was almost universally agreed in had weakened the American presidency for many decades to come$6
Some guessed or hoped that the results of the recent poll which showed increases in support for resignation as a way to spare the nation a trial in which Ms Lewinsky and Linda Tripp would be star witnesses would weaken Clinton s resolve$6
Some leaders urged him to keep quiet but his wife Bonnie encouraged him to tell his colleagues immediately despite the momentous vote that was nearing on the floor$6
The Republicans public support has shriveled to percent in the new Times CBS News poll its lowest level in years and it could go lower once the fact of impeachment sinks in$6
The commentators had been set to carry the congressional ratification of the inevitable vote but suddenly the most plugged in reporters were caught off guard$6
The conflict now enters uncharted seas since the Nixon resignation cut the matter short and the Johnson trial occurred in a different America with no nuclear weapons or cable television or public opinion polls$6
The months leading up to the impeachment of President Clinton had become a series of televised anticlimaxes but the hours before the vote made up for that lack of drama$6
The result is that after Saturday s expected impeachment vote after Livingston s unexpected announcement the mission of the Senate remains the same$6
The speaker is second in line to the presidency after the vice president$6
They had threatened to withhold their votes for him in the election in January that would formally make him speaker$6
Through cooperation they can guide the Senate toward a punishment that fixes Clinton in history as a president who lied under oath but avoids the taint of partisan vengeance associated with the House impeachment vote$6
We would like to see Lott reach for a starring role in history$6
Who who among us has not sinned But no one said that Livingston s disclosure or the mild Democratic attempts to exploit it would influence their votes on impeachment$6
With something of the political elan the president showed in initiating the Iraq attack as his own impeachment loomed House Republicans battered in public opinion polls had found a rocket s red glare of their own$6
You may have the votes today to impeach him but you don t have the American people$6
You say polls are against this$6
As Livingston said in his statement Thursday These indiscretions were not with employees on my staff and I have never been asked to testify under oath about them Democrats hoped that Livingston s seemingly drastic action would wake up the House to how poisoned the atmosphere had become and might prompt Republicans to reconsider the impeachment of Clinton$7
Bob Livingston the incoming speaker of the House took no public role Friday as the debate unfolded on whether to impeach President Clinton$7
But I cannot do that job or be the kind of leader that I would like to be under current circumstances Then he bolted from the House chamber nearly knocking reporters and members down$7
But he attempted to draw a contrast with the allegations against the president asserting I want to assure everyone that these indiscretions were not with employees on my staff and I have never been asked to testify under oath about them The disclosure of the speaker elect s marital infidelities disclosed in Rollcall a Capitol Hill newspaper sent a new jolt of uncertainty among lawmakers as they prepared for the momentous debate over the president s admitted misbehavior in office and whether he should be impeached and tried by the Senate$7
Democrats offered no immediate comment but Republicans were braced to hear Livingston s admissions alluded to in the debate Friday by Democrats who have decried the investigation of the president as basically a partisan and unfair rummaging through his sex life$7
During Friday s debate a handful of Democrats made only oblique allusions to human failures$7
Flynt said earlier this year that he wanted to expose the hypocrisy of those in Washington who are investigating Clinton and in October offered million to anyone who could prove they had had affairs with members of Congress$7
He quit in one breathtaking utterance as if flicking a trump card onto the heap of impeachment angst festering before his eyes in the debating chamber$7
He said Friday that this larger investigation to be published perhaps as soon as January would reveal what he described as indiscretions of several other Republicans$7
He said he had no connection with the White House but that he had hired an investigative firm based in Washington and made up of former employees of the FBI and the CIA$7
He spent most of the day in a private office off the chamber avoiding the gauntlet of reporters who lay in wait for him between the House and his regular office across the street$7
He spent some time Friday morning sprawled in a chair in the back of the House chamber listening to the debate over whether to impeach Clinton for lying about his own sexual indiscretions$7
He would not confirm whether the firm is Terry Lenzner s Investigative Group Inc which has done work for the president s private lawyers$7
His disclosure followed an investigation by Larry Flynt publisher of Hustler the sex magazine who said Friday at a news conference in Beverly Hills Calif that his publication had learned that Livingston had had adulterous affairs during the last years$7
His previous hours had been his most visible in the month since his party nominated him as speaker and perhaps the most excruciating in his public career He spent most of the day in a chaotic procedural wrangle over the terms of Friday s debate he ended it by telling his Republican colleagues that he had had extramarital affairs during his year tenure in Congress$7
I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow Livingston announced to a shocked and silent chamber in an act that left the Republican Party in total chaos just hours before the vote to impeach Clinton$7
I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow Livingston declared flabbergasting all attending the impeachment debate and the nation watching beyond$7

It has suddenly come to my attention that there are individuals working together with the media who are investigating my personal background in an effort to find indiscretions which may be exploitable against me and my party on the eve of the upcoming historic vote on impeachment Livingston declared in a statement after appearing before a shocked House Republican conference to head off the disclosure as it surfaced in news reports$7
It was also a debate about relativism vs$7
Larry Flint publisher of Hustler earlier this year advertised an offer of a million bounty for information about e of members of Congress guilty of sexual indiscretions$7
Livingston left the conference surrounded by Capitol police not taking questions from waiting reporters$7
Livingston met privately with his closest advisers Friday as the impeachment debate unfolded$7
Livingston presented a fresh note of shock to the impeachment debate against President Clinton on Thursday night as the Republican leader was forced to admit to his Republican colleagues that he had carried on adulterous affairs in his past$7
Livingston was unavailable to reporters Friday$7
Some of his colleagues believed he had made a mistake in disclosing Thursday night just as the House was moving into the divisive debate over impeachment that he had on occasion strayed from my marriage He told Republican leaders late Thursday afternoon that Hustler magazine was going to expose his affairs early next year$7
The House debate was not history$7
The debate over the president s fate would go forward Republicans later insisted drawing distinctions between the speaker elect s revelations and the sex and mendacity scandal that has put Clinton on the brink of impeachment$7
The ghosts of Watergate hung over the House chamber$7
Then as on Thursday night Republicans voiced suspicions that Democratic defenders of the president instigated media investigations in an effort to embarrass the Clinton s principal accusers$7
Through the efforts of Kenneth Starr the independent counsel under the law enacted in the wake of Watergate the investigation spread to examine Clinton s affair with a White House intern$7
Tom DeLay R Texas was a debate about relativism vs$7
Tom DeLay of Texas who has led the Republican effort to force Clinton from office dismissed his and other arguments as moral relativism$7
Tom DeLay the jagged edge exterminator who may next up in the speaker roundelay was choked up praising the greatness of Livingston for understanding that this was a debate about relativism versus absolute truth What could be more relative than a Republican who has hidden a lot of affairs trying to impeach a president for lying about his Spurred by Larry Flynt s bounty for sinnuendo the city was braced for more craziness$7
Tom Sawyer D Ohio compared Clinton on Friday to Sir Thomas More executed for treason in because of his religious beliefs$7
While Congress was debating CNN showed anti aircraft fire in Baghdad in one box$7
As Tim Russert said to Tom Brokaw on NBC Tom knock us all over In the echo chamber that television news so often becomes the shared mantra had been weightier in early morning$8
Dick Gephardt the minority leader declared the politics of personal destruction has to end But as all the jabbering and political posturing continued as reporters raced to cover the president s statement about the impeachment and the latest briefings from the Pentagon there was little time to focus on the profound cultural message beneath those rhetorical flourishes$8
He has one great advantage Two thirds of the American public continues to voice its approval of his political stewardship whatever it thinks of him as a man$8
If the political and military action had not intruded it might have been more obvious that the debate on the House floor sent a message about vast divisions in politics and morality signaling how deep a cultural fissure this crisis has opened$8
In a few short days we have managed to make the terms surreal bizarre split screen America shocking runaway train and politics of personal destruction useless cliches$8
In addition to narrow legal issues of guilt or innocence they can weigh considerations of party the nation s future their own individual political well being and almost anything else they care to weigh in reaching a verdict$8
In an intriguing report on NBC Tim Russert described discussions among a bipartisan group of senators about a censure that would involve some form of presidential confession a fine and a joint congressional request that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr not prosecute Clinton in the courts$8
In fact the whole political culture of the s with its criminalization of political conduct and its seeming indifference to important national and international issues has fallen into disrepute with ordinary Americans$8
In the toxic politics of century s end in Washington the inconceivable has become the commonplace$8
In undertaking this work the Senate must also reassure the American people that a decisive wisdom at the core of our messy looking political system has not melted down$8
Indeed in as fine a piece of political irony as one could ask for he has already sought to enlist former Sen$8
It is unfair$8
It s a terrible capitulation to the negative political forces that are consuming our political system and our country Gephardt said adding that the events of the last few days showed life imitates farce We need to stop destroying imperfect people at an unattainable altar of public morality he said urging his colleagues to step back from the abyss and reject resignation impeachment and vicious self righteousness $8
Journalists are seen by many as jackals indifferent to whatever personal suffering or national angst they may cause as long as they get the story and none too concerned about accuracy$8
Justice is so important to the most humble among us Hyde said$8
Livingston allowed GOP partisans to block censure in the House$8
Livingston and his right wing colleagues the Tom DeLays the Henry Hydes the Bob Barrs were on a mission of destruction and would not be denied$8
Livingston walked off the floor like the sheriff in some bullet pocked political High Noon discarding the leadership badge he had wrested from the earlier speaker casualty Newt Gingrich$8
One s self esteem gets utterly crushed at times like this sighed Henry Hyde another tormenter of the president who also had to admit that he had succumbed to temptation$8
Republicans called Clinton a liar even as he was committing American pilots to the skies over Iraq and Democrats accused their rivals of conducting a political lynching or a political coup d etat$8
Robert Menendez D NJ was probably closer to the truth when he said I warn my colleagues that you will reap the bitter harvest of the unfair partisan seeds you sow today One of the many strange events of the past couple of weeks was the way in which virtually all of the previously undecided Republicans the so called moderates surrendered their independence and lined up like lackeys to follow the right wing s lead$8
The GOP can no longer conceal that it is a party of extremists of right wing absolutists a party out of step with the political and cultural orientation of most Americans$8
The Republicans will pay a huge price for their brazen utterly partisan attempt to drag a president from the White House in defiance of the will of the people$8
The announcement was as Brokaw put it at least partly a political ploy and the repercussions were immediate$8
The last week seemed to crystallize the long term decline in political civility$8
The party s contempt for the voters was arrogantly but quite adequately summed up by Alan Simpson the former senator from Wyoming who said The attention span of Americans is which movie is coming out next month and whether the quarterly report on their stock will change If the voters are the dopes that Mr Simpson thinks they are then come everyone will have forgotten there was an impeachment crisis$8
There was no way to roam and zoom in for reaction shots as at a political convention$8
There were hardly enough shorthand terms or split screens to cover the activity$8
They don t think they re going to pay a political price for this and if they do they don t care$8
And we must do it so every kid in America can see it$9
The White House was keeping the journalists quarantined outside this year but encouraged them to bring their kids$9
