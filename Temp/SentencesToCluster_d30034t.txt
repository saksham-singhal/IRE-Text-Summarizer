Taiwan s Foreign Ministry on Thursday blamed administrative negligence for an incident in which Nobel Peace Prize winner Josi Ramos Horta was left stranded at the airport for hours after being refused entry
Opposition supporters alleged the incident Wednesday night was politically motivated
Ramos Horta is an advocate of independence for Indonesian controlled East Timor and newspapers reported Taiwan had formerly barred him to avoid antagonizing Indonesia
But Ramos Horta s previous persona non grata status had been ordered lifted by the Foreign Ministry in August leaving no reason why he should have been refused entry by airport immigration when he came to town Wednesday night ministry spokesman Roy Wu told a news conference
This incident accentuated the problem with administrative relations it needs to be improved
It s a fact Wu told a news conference
Ramos Horta had a rough time Wednesday night
Immigration officials would not let him in then he tried to catch a flight out but missed the plane
Eventually the Foreign Ministry intervened and let Ramos Horta enter Taiwan
He went only as far as the airport hotel
Conflicting reports indicate Ramos Horta was stuck at the airport for between four and seven hours
Ramos Horta was carrying a Portuguese passport which should have permitted him visa free entry to Taiwan for up to days newspapers said
The opposition Democratic Progressive Party alleged Ramos Horta had been refused entry because he planned to speak on behalf of Chen Shui bian s campaign to be re elected as mayor of Taipei
Chen is Taiwan s most prominent DPP politician
This sort of incident shows that Taiwan is just not qualified to be called a democratic nation DPP Secretary General Chiu Yi jen told a news conference
Ramos Horta sought to play down the incident before leaving town Thursday
I don t want to make a big problem out of it
I have been to many countries
The only countries that don t allow me in would be countries like Iraq Iran he told reporters before catching an afternoon flight to attend a conference in Australia

JAKARTA Indonesia AP As a UN envoy trotted toward an Indonesian army helicopter East Timorese protesters spilled onto the runway tarmac and shouted their anger at nervous soldiers
Sent to make peace in Indonesian controlled East Timor Jamsheed Marker s recent hasty departure from the troubled territory signaled how easily tensions there can boil over
Yet Marker who is visiting Indonesia to promote a UN designed blueprint for autonomy in the former Portuguese colony said Monday that both sides in the bitter conflict were displaying a newfound taste for compromise
In an interview with The Associated Press Marker admitted that a peaceful solution remains distant
But in a big step forward he said many separatist activists were no longer pressing for an immediate vote on independence
They don t want independence tomorrow said Marker who was interviewed in a Jakarta hotel suite after his trip to East Timor
In other progress Indonesia and Portugal will send diplomats to open interest sections in each other s capitals next month
Formal diplomatic relations however will not be resumed
Also in January the two countries are scheduled to embark on a new round of UN sponsored peace talks in New York
Turmoil has plagued East Timor ever since Indonesian troops invaded in unleashing a separatist rebel war and the resentment of a population pummeled by human rights abuses
Talks were revived earlier this year after the ouster of authoritarian President Suharto but differences remain over a definition of autonomy that would suit all parties
Separatists want it to be transitional while Indonesia is offering East Timorese partial control of their affairs in exchange for international recognition of its sovereignty
Jakarta wants to handle foreign defense and financial affairs
Fears are widespread that more unrest in East Timor could derail the negotiations
On Monday Marker voiced his concern in a meeting with East Timor s jailed rebel chief Xanana Gusmao
I said there was a lot of tension in East Timor and that he and his people ought to do everything they can to reduce it said Marker a former Pakistani ambassador to the United Nations
Tempers flared but there was no violence during protests timed for Marker s weekend trip to Dili the seaside capital of the half island territory of people
On Sunday separatist protesters tore down a fence at the commercial airport and pushed past soldiers with automatic rifles as they tried in vain to speak to Marker as he left
During a visit last year Indonesian soldiers killed two pro independence demonstrators outside a hotel where Marker was staying
Activists have alleged that Indonesia secretly ferried troops into East Timor in spite of pledges to reduce the number
Marker said Jakarta had advised him of troop rotations and that UN staff were monitoring the situation
Marker was scheduled to talk with Indonesian President BJ Habibie on Tuesday and will leave Indonesia on Wednesday to prepare for another batch of meetings in the New Year
If you ask me Do you have a solution then the answer is I don t he said
But I think there are ways of getting there and the first thing is to have peace and quiet 
In a decision welcomed as a landmark by Portugal European Union leaders Saturday backed calls for a referendum to decide the fate of East Timor the former Portuguese colony occupied by Indonesia since 
A definitive solution to the East Timor question will not be possible without free consultation to establish the real will of the East Timorese people the EU leaders said in statement after their year end summit
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said the statement marked the first time the EU had backed Lisbon s call for the East Timorese to vote on whether to opt for independence or remain under Indonesian rule
Indonesia has resisted such calls for a referendum and maintains thousands of troops to keep order in the half island territory
The EU statement also urged Indonesia to bring about a real and substantial reduction in troop levels and called for the establishment of a permanent UN presence in East Timor
The leaders repeated a demand that Indonesia release jailed Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao and all political prisoners
