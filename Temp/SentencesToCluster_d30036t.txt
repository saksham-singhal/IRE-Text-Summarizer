A day after winning the Nobel Prize for literature Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago insisted that while he was delighted to win the award it could just as easily have gone to many other Portuguese writers
I m not the only one who deserved it said the first Portuguese language author to obtain the prestigious award
There have been other Portuguse authors like Fernando Pessoa whose work would justify Nobels Speaking at a packed press coference in Madrid Saramago joked about how he heard he had won the prize from German air hostess at Frankfurt airport as he waited for a flight home to Spain s Canary Islands
The news left the year old writer no choice but to leave the airport and return to the city s book fair to meet the press and public
At that moment I was over the moon and returning to the book fair the only thing I was worried about was that the whole thing was an error said Saramago
Dismissing the Vatican paper s disapproval Thursday of his achievment Saramago a known atheist quipped that he was aware that the Pope had been among the jury I wouldn t have won the prize The Vatican is easily upset said Saramago I think that the Vatican should keep its mind on its prayers and leave people alone 
Meanwhile in Portugal where Saramago is scheduled to arrive on Tuesday the delight at the Swedish Academy s award for Saramago was reflected in the daily papers with even the country s three daily sports papers ample space to the event
The two leading dailies Publico and Diario de Noticias gave over their entire front pages to Saramago
Lisbon City Hall rushed out posters saying Congratulations Jose Saramago which were hung up around the capital during the night
Saramago was born into a poor illiterate family in Azinhaga a small town near Lisbon
He never finished university but continued to study part time while supporting himself as a metalworker
Nothing in my life would have led one to think I d win the Nobel Prize said Saramago
I wasn t born to win the Nobel
I didn t have my own books until I was His first novel published in Terra do Pecado or Country of Sin was a tale of peasants in moral crisis
For the next years Saramago a communist who opposed the year conservative dictatorship of Antonio Salazar published only a few travel and poetry books while he worked as a journalist
He returned to fiction only after Salazar s regime was toppled by a military uprising in 
Since the s his works have been translated into more than languages
Regarding the future Saramago said the book he is currently working on will be called The Cavern and deals with a modern version of myth of Plato and the cave
When Alfred Nobel wrote the directions establishing a literature prize in his name he chose an unclear word and scratched out a few letters
Questions about the prize have engaged and piqued the literary world ever since
A new chapter in the mystery will be written Thursday when the Swedish Academy announces this year s winner of the world s most prestigious prize for writers
The prize focuses intense media attention on the Swedish capital and the clamor of journalists generally drowns out a question Why does the world care so much about the literary choices of a handful of people in a quiet and remote country Does the Nobel Prize really recognize the best When asked that question Swedish Academy permanent secretary Sture Allen smiled and said Look at the list of prizewinners The answer obscures as much as it clarifies
On one hand the Nobel Prize has recognized world renowned writers such as Isaac Bashevis Singer and brought little known wonders to light such as Wislawa Szymborska
But the prize arguably also has honored the mediocre heaping attention on those who would have been more fairly served by obscurity
Among them is the winner of the first prize in Sully Prudhomme
That choice was denounced by Sweden s leading literary light August Strindberg and a group of Swedes sent a letter to Leo Tolstoy apologizing for the Academy s slight in not choosing him
Arguments over the Academy s choices are inevitable considering the instructions they were given
Nobel s will says the prize should recognize literature that works in an ideal direction What exactly he meant by ideal is unclear and the Academy s choices have reflected the confusion
The Academy has chosen to interpret the word to apply to works ranging from the good hearted charm of Szymborska s poetry to the crushing hopelessness of Samuel Beckett s writings
When Nobel wrote the word ideal in Swedish idealisk he superimposed the last couple of letters over previous one
Allen was so curious to understand Nobel s thoughts that he engaged a forensic expert to try to find out what the earlier letters were
The expert succeeded to a point
He found that the first word Nobel wrote was idealirad a word that doesn t exist
Despite the inclarity around the edges Allen said he is confident that the Academy s choices bolster Nobel s core idea that literature would be the basis for some kind of progress About this year s choice he won t say more than that the Academy is bound to keep its deliberations secret
But observers love to speculate on who might win even who s on the shortlist for the prize this year worth million kronor about dlrs 
Names that freuqently come up in the guessing include VS Naipaul China s Bei Dao and Pa Kin American poet John Ashbery and Jose Saramago of Portugal
Former US President Jimmy Carter who seems a perennial Nobel Peace Prize also ran could have won the coveted honor in had it not been for strict deadline rules for nominations
That prize was shared by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin for signing the Camp David peace accords
However the five member Norwegian awards committee also wanted to honor Carter for brokering the pact only to be foiled by their own rules
The Nobel committee wanted to give the prize to all three said Geir Lundestad the current committee s nonvoting secretary said on Sunday
But Carter had not been nominated when the deadline ran out Nominations postmarked by Feb
are accepted for that year s prize
The committee can add it own nominations at its first meeting of the year usually in early March
The Camp David accords were not signed until Sept
about five weeks before that year s peace prize was annouCkuld not give him the prize the Norwegian committee recognized in the awards citation the positive initiative taken by President Jimmy Carter Lundestad said the committee which works in deep secrecy in its five or six meetings a year tried to find a loophole in the rules which are overseen by the Swedish Nobel Foundation
The Nobel Prizes were endowed by Alfred Nobel a Swedish industrialist whose inventions included dynamite
In his will Nobel endowed the prizes and said the peace prize should be picked by a Norwegian committee and the rest by Swedish institutions
Lundestad said the committee turned to the Swedish Nobel Foundation for advice on Carter because it was a question of principle
Stig Ramel a Swede who was then director of the Nobel Foundation advised against breaking the rules Lundestad said by telephone
Normally the committee refuses to discuss past candidates in keeping with a strict policy of secrecy in which selection details are sealed for years
Lundestad made an exception because Ramel revealed the Carter dilemma in his memoirs
Carter has repeatedly been nominated for the Nobel prize for his consistent and wide ranging peace efforts
He is also among the candidates for the prize being announced in Oslo on Friday
However early speculation leans more toward someone involved in the Northern Ireland peace process Czech President Vaclav Havel to mark the th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of his country or a human rights activist to mark the th anniversary of the UN Human Rights Charter
While the committee wanted to honor Carter and could not with hindsight some regretted the prize for other reasons
Four years after Begin won the prize the Israeli prime minister ordered an invasion of southern Lebanon in which thousands of civilians died
Kare Kristiansen who served on the peace prize committee from to once said that had the committee waited Begin probably would not have won
Three American pharmacologists were awarded the Nobel Prize on Monday for their surprising discoveries of how natural production of a gas nitric oxide can mediate a wide variety of bodily actions
Those include widening blood vessels helping to regulate blood pressure initiating erections battling infections preventing formation of blood clots and acting as a signal molecule in the nervous system
The prize for physiology or medicine went to Dr Robert Furchgott of the State University of New York in Brooklyn Dr Louis Ignarro of the University of California at Los Angeles and Dr Ferid Murad of the University of Texas Medical School in Houston
The announcement of a significant phase of the discoveries by two of Monday s winners at a meeting in elicited an avalanche of research activities in many different laboratories around the world said the Nobel committee at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm which makes the awards
Its citation said that the research had led to new treatments for treating heart and lung diseases shock and impotence
Ignarro discovered the principle that led to the use of Viagra as an anti impotency drug said Dr Sten Orrenius a professor of toxicology at the Karolinska Institute
Nitric oxide starts the process by which blood vessels in the penis widen to produce an erection
Nitric oxide a chemical relative of the anesthetic gas nitrous oxide is better known as a common air pollutant formed when nitrogen burns such as in automobile exhaust fumes
But scientists now know it is distributed widely in the body
The discoveries honored on Monday were made largely during the s at a time when scientists knew that bacteria produced nitric oxide but did not think it was important in animals and humans
The award committee said that this was the first discovery that a gas can act as a signal molecule in the organism The discovery was startling because nitric oxide is totally different from any other known signal molecule and so unstable that it is converted to nitrate and nitrite within seconds Recipients of the Nobel Prize including some who have lobbied for it for years often profess surprise on learning of their award
This year s winners were refreshingly candid
Furchgott said he had planned to sleep late on Monday a holiday but was awakened at at his home in Hewlett NY He said that he knew that previous Nobel prize winners had nominated him for the award but that he still was somewhat surprised to receive it
I guess I had some good friends voting Furchgott said
He said he could not get back to sleep
Murad said he had pondered the odds and thought that maybe I could win the prize if not now maybe in a couple of years He described the award as the culmination of a career and said that when it happens it s incredible Ignarro was traveling in Italy
Dr Gerald Levey the dean of UCLA said we actually anticipated this day for about four years now The three winners never worked together but we talked a lot of shop talk at meetings Furchgott said
Dr Valentin Fuster the president of the American Heart Association and the head of cardiology at Mt
Sinai Hospital in Manhattan said that the discovery of nitric oxide and its function is one of the most important in the history of cardiovascular medicine Doctors have learned from the prize winning research that in heart disease the endothelium or inner lining of arteries makes less nitric oxide
Drugs like nitroglycerine however can help replenish stores of nitric oxide
Now drug companies are trying to develop more powerful heart drugs based on newer knowledge of nitric oxide s role as a signal molecule
Researchers have also learned that nitric oxide produced in the endothelium rapidly spreads through cell membranes to the underlying muscle cells in arteries
Then it can shut off muscle contractions in the arteries thus widening them and reducing blood pressure
Inhalation of nitric oxide gas has saved the lives of some people with certain lung diseases particularly infants who have developed dangerously high pulmonary blood pressure
But regulating the amount of nitric oxygen inhaled is critical because too much can be lethal
Nitric oxide plays a harmful role in the collapse of the circulatory system or shock resulting from overwhelming microbial infections
Bacteria can release products that cause white blood cells to release enormous amounts of nitric oxide
As a result blood pressure drops
Scientists are trying to develop drugs that can block production of nitric oxide in such infections
White blood cells also play a role in attacking cancerous cells
The gas can also induce a type of programmed cell death known as apoptosis
Scientists are studying nitric oxide s effects on the immune system to stop the growth of cancers
They are also exploring nitric oxide s possible role in regulating body temperature
Doctors are measuring the production of nitric oxide in the lungs and intestines to diagnose a number of ailments including asthma and colitis and are studying its role in menstruation
Nitric oxide formed in nerve cells spreads rapidly in all directions to activate cells in the vicinity and influence many functions like behavior and the mobility of the intestinal tract
Nitric oxide is also being studied for its role in smell and memory
Nitric oxide s role is still unfolding scientists have written thousands of scientific papers about it in recent years and have started a journal Nitric Oxide
The Nobel committee cited Furchgott for performing in an ingenious experiment that showed that a drug acetylcholine widened blood vessels only if the inner layer or endothelium was intact
Furchgott concluded that blood vessels widen because the endothelial cells produce a signal molecule that he called EDRF for endothelium derived relaxing factor which relaxes smooth muscle cells in blood vessels
Furchgott s findings led to a quest to identify the factor the citation said
OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE The citation did not refer to an accident in Furchgott s laboratory that played a major role in his discoveries
In in the Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology Furchgott wrote that on May in the first of a series of planned experiments on arteries from a rabbit a technician did not follow directions correctly
The technician performed one step of the experiment before instead of after he was supposed to wash out a drug used in an earlier phase of the experiment
Furchgott expected that the arteries would contract
Instead they relaxed
It was the first time he had seen the drugs under study produce such a reaction and he used the insight to plan additional experiments
Furchgott omitted the technician s name in that paper and in another in in the Journal of the American Medical Association
On Monday he said David Davidson was the technician
OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE The committee cited Ignarro for concluding in from a brilliant series of analyses conducted independently of Furchgott that EDRF was identical to nitric oxide
Furchgott said he and Ignarro made the announcement at the same symposium in at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn but the papers were not published until 
Murad was cited for work conducted over the years while he worked at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville Stanford University in Palo Alto Calif and Abbott Laboratories in Illinois
Murad said he felt fortunate to have heard Furchgott report his early work on EDRF in 
Murad showed that a gas could regulate important cellular functions and studied how nitroglycerin and related heart drugs led to the release of nitric oxide
OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE In his early training at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland Murad worked in the laboratory of Dr Theodore Rall who also trained another Nobel prize winner Dr Alfred Gilman of the University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas
Gilman said in an interview that he believed Rall now retired and living in Charlottesville Va was the first scientist to have trained two Nobel Prize winners
In addition Rall worked with Dr Earl Sutherland who also won a Nobel Prize
In his early reseach years Murad worked on a chemical known as cyclic guanosine monophosphate which later turned out to be critical in the nitric oxide story
Murad s trainees referred to the early work as dumping experiments because all they could do in the laboratory at the time was crudely add various hormones and agents to slices of tissue cell cultures
It took years to develop the more refined techniques that led to the understanding of nitric oxide s many roles in the body
But for many years most of the scientific community was skeptical of the ability of a free radical like nitric oxide to activate an enzyme Murad said in when he and Furchgott shared the Albert Lasker basic medical research award
OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE The Nobel Prizes were created by the will of Alfred Nobel whose invention of dynamite involved the use of nitroglycerine
The award committee noted an odd twist to this year s award
When Nobel developed chest pain from heart disease it said he refused to take the nitroglycerine his doctor prescribed because he knew it caused headache
Nobel dismissed nitroglycerine s benefit in the relief of chest pain
Nobel died in 
The prize that the three scientists will share is now worth 
Three American researchers on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize for discovering how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the cardiovascular system a breakthrough with applications ranging from hardening of the arteries to impotence
The prestigious prize went to Robert F
Furchgott Louis J
Ignarro and Ferid Murad
Furchgott is a pharmacologist at the State University of New York in Brooklyn Ignarro is at University of California Los Angeles and Murad is at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston
The citation by the Karolinska Institute said it was a senation that the simple common air pollutant nitric oxide which is formed when nitrogen burns could exert important functions in the organism
Because of the research we know today that nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the nervous system as a weapon against infections and as a regulator of blood pressure Signal transmission by a gas that is produced by one cell penetrates through membranes and regulates the function of another cell represents an entirely new principle the citation said
Understanding how nitric oxide transmits the signals has sparked research on a wide range of new drugs including those that can be used in the treatment of heart problems artherosclerosis shock and impotence
The prize amount of million kronor dlrs is divided equally among the three
Last year the prize went to Stanley B
Prusiner of the University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of prions the rogue proteins identified as causing Mad Cow Disease
Winners generally aren t known outside the medical community although the list of laureates contains a few familiar names including Ivan Pavlov tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch and DNA researchers Francis Crick and James Watson
Generally they are researchers who have made discoveries that sound small on paper but carry large consequences
Among other well known names to receive the prize is David Baltimore although he shared the prize in long before becoming one of the world s most visible AIDS researchers
Alan Cormack of the United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield may not be familiar names but what they won the prize for in is a term known by most patients computer assisted tomography or CAT scan
The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be announced this year
Last Thursday the literature prize went to Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago
The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday the economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday
All the announcements are in Stockholm except for the peace prize which is given in Oslo Norway
The prizes are presented on Dec
the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel the industrialist and inventor of dynamite whose will established the prizes
Jose Saramago became the first writer in Portuguese to win the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday
His personal delight was seconded by a burst of public elation in his homeland
Saramago and Portuguese said they were pleased the Swedish Academy had finally acknowledged the literary contribution of Portugal a small country of million people bordering Spain on Europe s southwestern Iberian Peninsula
It has taken all of this century to win a Nobel Prize for the Portuguese language Saramago said at the Frankfurt Book Fair speaking through an interpreter
Saramago a soft spoken man known for his hard edged and iconoclastic views said he shared the honor with his country and he hoped winning the prize would make Portugal and its language more visible and audible I m personally very happy for myself
I m also happy for my country he said at the Frankfurt Book Fair in Germany where he was engulfed by well wishers offering roses
Back home President Jorge Sampaio said the award was a cause for great collective satisfaction Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said the award was above all a prize for Portugal and the Portuguese language which is spoken by million worldwide mostly in Brazil but also in Portugal s five former colonies in Africa
Saramago s controversial opinions and atheistic outlook have frequently clashed with the establishment and the general public
Even on the day he won the prize the Vatican newspaper L Osservatore Romano attacked the Swedish Academy s choice describing Saramago as an old school communist who had a substantially antireligious vision Undersecretary of State Sousa Lara was so upset by one of Saramago s novels in that he withdrew his name from Portugal s nominees for the European Literature Prize
At the time Lara said Saramago s novel O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo The Gospel according to Jesus Christ offended Portugal s Roman Catholic religious convictions and divided the country
The book describes a Christ who subject to human desires lives with Mary Magdalene and tries to back out of his crucifixion
I have not come to bring peace but the sword said Saramago an atheist at the time
He retreated in disgust with his Spanish wife Pilar del Rio to his home in Lanzarote in Spain s Canary Islands
He has never courted the kind of fame offered by literary prizes and his bluntness can sometimes offend
I am skeptical reserved I don t gush I don t go around smiling hugging people and trying to make friends he once said
A gaunt man with wisps of white hair Saramago was born in Azinhaga a small town near Lisbon
From a poor family he never finished university but continued to study part time while supporting himself as a metalworker
His first novel published in Terra do Pecado or Country of Sin was a tale of peasants in moral crisis
It sold badly but won enough recognition to propel him from the welder s shop to a literary magazine
But for the next years Saramago a communist who opposed the year conservative dictatorship of Antonio Salazar published only a few travel and poetry books while he worked as a journalist
He returned to fiction only after Salazar s regime was toppled by a military uprising in 
Since the s he has been one of Portugal s best selling contemporary writers and his works have been translated into more than languages
He first won critical acclaim abroad with his historical fantasy Memorial do Convento published in English in as Baltasar and Blimunda It is set during the Catholic inspired inquisition and explores the war between individuals and organized religion picking up Saramago s recurring theme of the loner struggling against authority
He is most frequently compared with Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez because his prose is often rooted in recognizable settings but at the same time tinged with magical elements
The Nobel citation praised his work that with parables sustained by imagination compassion and irony continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality Saramago remains a prominent nonconformist through his regular newspaper and radio commentaries though his views are always inspired by his deep concern for his fellow man
Blindness his most recent book to be translated into English is an unsettling allegory about the social meltdown as an inexplicable blindness sweeps through society
This blindness isn t a real blindness it s a blindness of rationality he said
We re rational beings but we don t behave rationally
If we did there d be no starvation in the world In the The History of the Siege of Lisbon a Lisbon proofreader mischievously inserts the word not into a text on the th century capture of the Portuguese capital from the Moors thereby fictionally altering the course of European history with a stroke of his pen
Such historical and literary mischief are Saramago trademarks
In his book The Stone Raft the Iberian Peninsula snaps off from the rest of the European continent and floats off into the North Atlantic apparently in a metaphorical search for identity away from the standardizing nature of the European Union of which Portugal and Spain are enthusiastic members
Saramago will receive the dlrs prize on Dec
in Stockholm
There s room for a few more names on a th century honor roll of writers and one will be added this week when the Swedish Academy announces the latest Nobel Literature laureate
Who is chosen and why stimulates animated conversation with readers as well as academics critics and the authors themselves
This year s winner or possibly winners will be announced Thursday the Academy disclosed Tuesday
The joke you hear is that it goes to people you never heard of said Ian Jack editor of London based Granta literary magazine
But the Nobel awarded most every year since also shines a light usually deservedly on wonderful writers few people have read he added
His favorites include Trinidad born VS Naipaul though he s convinced Naipaul probably won t win because of his dark pessimistic and often scathing portrayals of post colonial African culture
The academy keeps its deliberations secret
Who is considered seriously even who s nominated isn t disclosed
A writer s nationality by the terms of the prize founder Alfred Nobel s will is supposed to be irrelevant
Two can share the prize though the last time that happened was 
Winners are expected to personally receive it awards are not given posthumously
Looking at the process from afar Harold Bloom a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters said the award committee has an unsettling record of selections that are nationally correct and politically correct The winners list is prestigious he concedes but by no means uniformly lustrous
Absolutely not Outrageously not he said in a telephone interview from New York
They include all kinds of fifth raters
James Joyce never got one for heaven s sake
Neither did Marcel Proust Bloom s US favorites include Cormac McCarthy author of Blood Meridian Philip Roth author of American Pastoral and John Ashbery the best living poet A review of recent winners may foreshadow this year s laureate
Seven of the past were men does that favor a woman Two of the past three were poets does that favor a prose writer Four of the past wrote in English and the last three laureates are European
In comparison only three Asian writers have ever won
Bei Dao is a personal favorite of mine said Abe Harumasa editor in chief of the Japanese literary magazine Bungei
The choice could be interpreted as being motivated partly by politics given the poet s association with China s democracy movement but it s clear he s a wonderful poet Minoru Takeuchi a professor of Chinese literature at Japan s prestigious Kyoto University cited novelists Pa Kin and Xie Bing Xin as worthy
The latter is known for her portrayals of the struggles of Chinese women
China which translates and publishes the works of many Nobel winners desperately wants its first laureate he added
Spain s Nobel hopes are pinned on Francisco Ayala winner of this year s renowned Prince of Asturias prize said Jose Maria Martinez Cachero an author university professor and secretary of the jury that selected Ayala
Other presumed Latin candidates are Peru born Mario Vargas Llosa a member of the year old Royal Spanish Language Academy Martinez Cachero said and Portugal s Jose Saramago whose works have been translated into more than languages
For his part Saramago said in a recent Associated Press interview that he s weary of speculation that this year once again he might win
Let s not get into that he said
I just write

Ignarro and Ferid Murad of the United States on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize
They were given the prize for their discoveries concerning nitric oxide as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system according to the citiation from the Karolinska lnstitute
Furchgott is a pharmacologist at the State University of New York in Brooklyn Ignarro is at University of California Los Angeles and Murad is at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston

Jose Saramago a year old Portuguese writer who took up literature relatively late in life and whose richly imaginative novels soon won him a following of loyal readers across Europe and vocal admirers in the United States was awarded this year s Nobel Prize in Literature Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm
A tall balding man whose large tinted glasses often give him a mien of severity Saramago is the first Portuguese language writer and one of the first card carrying Communists to become a Nobel Literature laureate
He is also the fourth successive European to win the prize after Italy s Dario Fo in Poland s Wislawa Szymborska in and Ireland s Seamus Heaney in 
In its citation Thursday the Swedish Academy praised Saramago who with parables sustained by imagination compassion and irony continually enables us once again to apprehend an elusory reality Although Saramago discounts the influence of Latin American magical realism on his work his novels often use the supernatural allegorical paradoxical and irrational as ways of addressing complex questions of faith and existence
Many of his novels are set against a backdrop of political or historical events but it is his unwavering concern for individual fate that gives his fiction its distinctive voice and independent character
His best known books all published in the United States are Baltasar and Blimunda The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis The Stone Raft and The History of the Siege of Lisbon His latest book available in English Blindness in which all but one of his characters mysteriously become blind was described as his symphonic new novel by Andrew Miller in The New York Times Book Review on Sunday
There is no cynicism and there are no conclusions just a clear eyed and compassionate acknowledgment of things as they are a quality than can only honestly be termed as wisdom Miller himself a novelist wrote
We should be grateful when it is handed to us in such generous measures Saramago learned of his award Thursday at Frankfurt airport where he was preparing to fly home via Madrid to Lanzarote in the Canary Islands after attending the Frankfurt Book Fair
Earlier this week he participated in a round table of Portuguese writers on the topic Why I am still a Communist He immediately returned to the fair where he was received with cheers and bouquets of roses
I am personally very happy for myself he said
I am also happy for my country Later he told a news conference The Portuguese language had to wait years for this
There have to be ways and means of protecting the language so that it does not become a museum but is something that is alive
The writer s role is to protect it and work with it The award was also celebrated in Lisbon where President Jorge Sampaio described it as recognition of Portuguese culture while the local Communist leader Carlos Carvalho saw it as a credit to his own party
As a member of our party he noted solemnly Saramago makes a great contribution to our ideals and to the struggle for social change The laureate s fiction though is never overtly political
Saramago whose body of work includes poetry essays plays and a journal as well as novels is unusual for having emerged as a major literary figure only at the age of 
His novels have since been translated into languages selling particularly well in Portugal Brazil Spain Italy and Germany
While he has not been well known in the United States his novels have always been critically well received there
For all his late blooming though Saramago long dreamed of becoming a writer
Born into a family of rural laborers and raised in Lisbon he was forced by poverty to leave school while a teen ager and learn the trade of car mechanic
Yet he managed to publish a small novel at the age of 
Later he found work at a Lisbon publishing company but the oppressive and censorial atmosphere of the Salazar dictatorship discouraged him from writing
It was only after Portugal s April revolution that Saramago felt free to find his voice
A member of the Portuguese Communist Party since he served as editor of a Lisbon newspaper Diario de Noticias during an month period when the left looked likely to seize power in Portugal
But an anti Communist backlash in November forced him out of the newspaper and he began translating French texts into Portuguese to make ends meet
In the late s he also turned to novels publishing three in succession in and 
But it was in with Baltasar and Blimunda Memorial do Convento in Portuguese that he achieved his international breakthrough
This is a rich multifaceted and polysemous text that at the same time has a historical a social and an individual perspective the Swedish Academy noted Thursday
The insight and wealth of imagination to which it gives expression is characteristic of Saramago s work as a whole Set in th century Portugal during the Inquisition the book tells of the baroque efforts of a war veteran Baltasar and a visionary Blimunda to escape to the heavens aboard a flying machine powered by human wills captured by the hypersensory Blimunda
This fantastic story takes place against the very real background of the tortuous construction of the massive Mafra Convent by thousands of men held in the grip of the Inquisition
When the novel was published in the United States in Irving Howe acclaimed it as brilliant in The New York Times Book Review
Mr Saramago is constantly present as a voice of European skepticism a connoisseur of ironies Howe wrote
I think I hear in his prose echoes of Enlightenment sensibility caustic and shrewd In his next novel The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis which is also a homage to the great Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa who appears in it as a ghost Saramago sets his story in the early years of the Salazar dictatorship with the tale following the romantic and sexual misadventures of a poet physician
Writing in The New York Times Herbert Mitgang called it a rare old fashioned novel at once lyrical symbolic and meditative Saramago whose sense of literary freedom is evident in his unconventional punctuation and conflicting use of tenses sought a different form of freedom in The Stone Raft where he imagines the confusion unleashed when the Iberian peninsula suddenly breaks free from the rest of Europe and begins drifting toward the New World and threatens to collide with the Azores
To the delight of Britons Gibraltar is left behind
Unsurprisingly the bitter satire The Gospel According to Jesus Christ proved controversial with God shown as using the innocently human Jesus to create a religion that has spawned violence and intolerance
When a Lisbon jury picked the book as Portugal s entry for a European literary prize the country s conservative government vetoed the choice as blasphemous
It was then that Saramago decided to leave his small crowded apartment in Lisbon for the relative solitude of Lanzarote
The History of the Siege of Lisbon published in the United States last year is a whimsical tale set in motion by the decision of a humble proofreader at a publishing house to insert the word not into a key passage in a standard history of Portugal
With this lunatic creative act as Edmund White put it in The New York Times Book Review he totally derails the national saga by affirming that the crusaders did not in fact help liberate th century Lisbon from Moorish occupation
White ended his July review with a prescient remark
Word has it that Saramago is overdue for a Nobel Prize he noted
No candidate has a better claim to lasting recognition than this novelist With the recent publication of Blindness in the United States only Saramago s latest novel Todos os Nomes or All the Names still awaits translation into English
In the tradition of Andre Gide and Julian Green though he has now embarked on his journals
The fourth volume of these Cadernos de Lanzarote was just published in Lisbon
Saramago will receive his Nobel Prize worth the equivalent of this year at a ceremony in Stockholm on Dec
Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago whose capricious vision includes a section of Europe breaking off and floating out to sea on Thursday was named the winner of the Nobel Literature Prize
In its citation the Swedish Academy said it gave the award to Saramago for work that with parables sustained by imagination compassion and irony continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality Saramago wrote his breakthrough novel in Baltasar and Blimunda Perhaps his best known work is The Stone Raft in which the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from Europe for supernatural reasons and floats off into the Atlantic
That device allows him to comment ironically about the authorities and politicians perhaps especially about the major players in power politics Saramago s exuberant imagination and playfulness have made him one of Portugal s most popular contemporary novelists and his works have been translated into more than languages
In Blindness his most recent work to be translated into English a nameless man in a nameless country suddenly goes blind and the affliction quickly spreads through the country grim tale of social collapse
In s The Gospel According to Jesus Christ God and the devli negotiate about evil and Jesus tries to back out of his crucifixion
Saramago s idiosyncratic development of his own resonant style of fiction gives him a high standing he invokes tradition in a way that in the current state of things can be described as radical the Academy said in the citation for the million kronor dlrs prize 
Saramago pronounced sah rah MAH go is the fourth consecutive European to win the prestigious prize and the first laureate to write in Portuguese
He had long been seen as one of the strongest potential candidates for the prize and the frequent media queries about his prospects contrasted with his quiet personality
I am skeptical reserved I don t gush I don t go around smiling hugging people trying to make friends he told The Associated Press in a recent interview
I just write Saramago on Thursday had planned to leave Frankfurt Germany where he was attending the international book fair for his home in the Canary Islands
But Portuguese state radio said he was taken off the plane before departure and driven back to the fair where a crowd wa waiting for him
The literature prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite
The prizes have been awarded since a sixth prize in economics was started in 
According to the terms of Nobel s will the literature prize is to recognize writing that works in an ideal direction How to interpret that term has been widely debated
The Nobel Prize over the years has been given to writers with world views stretching from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett s works to the vivid epics of Iceland s Halldor Laxness
The prize even has gone occasionally to writers who did not work in fiction or poetry notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand Russell
Last year s prize went to Dario Fo the Italian playwright whose work combines gut busting comedy with acid social and political commentary
