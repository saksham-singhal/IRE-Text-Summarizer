The conclusions were mutual Brinkley said$17
We have mutually concluded that it would not be prudent to make these changes Brinkley said during a news conference held at the Johnson Space Center in Houston$17
We have margin on everything said flight director Bob Castle$18
Flight controllers fired one of the module s two maneuvering engines to raise it to an orbit about kilometers miles in space the station s public affairs office said$19
Its control system consists of thrusters and two large engines for major orbital changes$19
flight by hours to match the orbits would have forced similar shifts in the subsequent assembly flights and resulted in potentially unfavorable sun angles on the solar powered station engineers said$19

According to Interfax Lobachev said it made sense for Russia to control the project because the Russian built Zarya and a Russian built service module would perform most of the life support and navigational functions for the station s first five years$5
According to a report by the news agency Reuters President Boris Yeltsin s space adviser Yevgeny Shaposhnikov said Friday he was preparing a number of proposals on extending Mir s life past the year $5
After years of discussing planning and replanning we are about to launch hardware Gretchen McClain deputy associate administrator for the new station said at a news conference earlier this week$5
Agency chief Yuri Koptev said that taking part in the new station is the only hope for the beleaguered Russian space industry whose funding has collapsed since the Soviet collapse$5
Also Saturday the head of Russia s Mission Control Vladimir Lobachev was quoted as saying that Russia would take the lead role in managing the international space station during its first five years$5
Because of the collapse of the Russian economy doubts that Russia can produce enough rockets and other equipment to support both projects led Russia to promise that it would abandon Mir and destroy the station by next summer$5
Both sides concluded that it did not make sense The Russians struggling to find money for their space program with their nation in economic collapse had said they wanted to transfer thousands of pounds of newer equipment and scientific instruments from Mir as an economy move$5
Daniel Goldin the administrator of NASA said at a news conference following the launching Now we only have launches to go about hours of space walks and countless problems But because of all the partner nations trusting each other and working together he said the international space station is going to be a reality Even as the new space station is coming together questions continue about the fate of Russia s existing space laboratory the year old Mir$5
Furthermore Russian engineers are more experienced in this job and NASA officials are aware of this he said$5
His Russian counterpart Yuri Koptev said the launch was a vital vindication for the troubled Russian space industry proving it could play a major role in space operations$5
However in recent weeks Russian officials have been lobbying to find ways to extend Mir s life$5
However some critics questioned the Russians motives wondering if the requested orbital change was part of plan to delay the decommissioning and destruction of Mir which the Russians have agreed to do next summer$5
I would like to knock on wood which is rather common in the Russian tradition said Alexander Krasnov a deputy chief of Russian Space Agency s manned flight department$5
James Van Laak NASA s deputy manager of operations for the space station said Friday that the agency had not received any formal proposals about extending Mir s life$5
Koptev assailed some Russian space engineers who continue to insist that more money should be put into Russia s own battered year old Mir space station to extend its lifetime instead of committing more funds to the new space outpost$5
NASA was surprised last week when Russia s prime station contractor proposed the orbital position change just two and a half weeks before launch of the first part of the new station$5
NASA will consider ideas for salvaging Mir s research equipment to use on the international space station he said but only if it does not interfere with assembling the new station$5
NASA would find such a proposal unacceptable if it has any measurable impact on the international space station Van Laak said in a telephone interview from the Johnson Space Center in Houston No one has any objection to Mir or keeping it operational if the Russians find a way to support both projects but they have to demonstrate they can Yuri Koptev head of the Russian Space Agency said the launching of Zarya a pound space tugboat that will supply power and propulsion in the early stages of station construction was a needed vindication for the troubled Russian space program$5
Now we only have launches to go about hours of space walks and countless problems but because of the trust and mutual respect the international space station is going to be a reality NASA chief Daniel Goldin told a press conference after the launch$5
Previously space officials have said the station would be jointly controlled from Moscow and Houston with the US space agency NASA taking a lead role$5
Russia s financing problems delayed the initial launch by a year and some critics have said the station amounts to an expensive way for NASA to keep Russia s beleaguered space program alive$5
Russian Space Agency general director Yuri Koptev told reporters the maneuver was carried out with great accuracy and the ton core module was cruising through space without any problems$5
Some people are glued to one thing Mir and don t care about the rest Koptev said at a recent news conference$5
Support for such options has been growing in recent weeks among Russian space officials astronauts and nationalists who see Mir as a symbol of Russian achievements in space$5
The Mir competes with the international space station for very critical resources and for funding Brinkley said$5
The Russian space industry is alive and well and is perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station Koptev said$5
The Russian space industry is alive and well and is perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station he said$5
The Russians have so little money that the United States and other partners in the international station fear that money spent on Mir will prevent Russia from meeting its obligations with the new project$5
The heads of the space agencies of nations participating in the project watched the lift off from a distance of about kilometers miles $5
The heads of the space agencies of the United States Russia Japan and Canada along with the European Space Agency met in Moscow on Saturday to discuss the project the Interfax news agency reported$5
The international space station is a US led successor to Russia s Mir space station and is being heralded by space officials as the vehicle for unprecedented international cooperation in space in the st century$5
The project would allow Russia to keep up to jobs over the next years$5
The space agency heads agreed on a schedule for future meetings and on holding a scientific conference on the project somewhere in Europe at an unspecified date$5
WASHINGTON NASA and the Russian Space Agency have agreed to set aside a last minute Russian request to launch an international space station into an orbit closer to Mir officials announced Friday$5
While putting the new station closer to Russia s year old Mir station would make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies from the old outpost to the new one the request came too late to be acted on said Randy Brinkley NASA s space station program manager$5
Flight controllers urged caution$6
