Just four years ago it was a good bet that Newt Gingrich would be the pivotal figure in US politics at the turn of the millennium
Seemingly overnight he had taken a moribund minority party and turned it into a pumped up issue driven House majority
With a promise to balance the budget end welfare and represent more conservative social values he appeared to have rearranged the political map for Congress just as Ronald Reagan had done for the presidency
But Gingrich s leadership is now so shaky that even if he maintains his hold on the speaker s office he is in danger of marginalization
A change this dramatic suggests something far more profound than a miscalculation about election tactics
What looked like one of the major realignments in US political history might turn out to have been nothing but a temporary shift
The Gingrich revolution was fueled by anger a revolt of white working class Americans against what they perceived as a Democratic bias in favor of blacks and other minorities and a middle class rejection of the politics of big government and big deficits
They were the same resentments that Ronald Reagan had exploited so successfully
But old political habits and a moribund Republican leadership allowed the Democrats to retain control of Congress throughout the s and turned Reagan s economic program into an undisciplined tax cutting spree that created prosperity along with huge budget gaps
Gingrich s attention grabbing rhetoric energy and talent for political organization finally took Reagan s formula for success to the congressional elections in 
But once in power he ran head on into Bill Clinton whose political instincts were even better
The president co opted parts of the Contract With America particularly the balanced budget and welfare reform
He adapted the Republican social message into a call for things like school uniforms and television rating systems which symbolized more responsibility and parental control without supporting government intrusion into private lives
The Republican right s genuine contempt for Clinton was based in part on the well known flaws in the president s character
But it was mainly a reaction to the ease with which he had diverted what was supposed to be the flood tide of their revolution
They expected that the genuine successes of Gingrich s first year in office would lead to still larger victories for minimal government and taxes unfettered free enterprise and a return to conservative Christian values
But the public was happy to be led in another direction and focus on the concerns of aging baby boomers about health care and Social Security
The government that was seen as the enemy when the issues were budgetary once again looked like a potential ally
Back in both parties were so stunned by the sudden change in their congressional fortunes that they may have overestimated what it all meant
In particular they may not have realized how quickly good economic times a drop in crime and national welfare reform could blunt the power of race in US politics
The Democrats had become literally a minority party as white voters resentfully identified their policies with cities blacks and immigrants
But last week union workers and Catholics returned to the Democratic fold
Without race as a wedge issue the solid black Democratic vote became a powerful advantage in key states
Blacks women and Latinos angry at Republican anti immigration initiatives were the winning coalition in California North Carolina and New York
The speaker was right to say this was not the election we expected There may indeed be a Republican majority in America but it appears to resemble the Republicanism of Dwight Eisenhower rather than Newt Gingrich pro business wary of debt and with an inherent distaste for bringing up messy social issues like abortion
The Republicans who have begun talking about compassionate conservatism and the politics of inclusion may be peddling political mush but they peddled it to victory on Tuesday
The congressional Republican Party s long sojourn in the wilderness of the House minority may have left it too accustomed to opposition to figure out what it can be for and too attached to the politics of anger to make sense of a nation in the mood for moderation
Gingrich has suggested that his mistake was to let the Republicans drift along on the politics of impeachment when they should have been almost maniacally focused on things like tax cuts
But looking maniacal is what got them into trouble in the first place
Winning control of Congress after so many years was very tough for Gingrich in 
But it will be ten times tougher to forge a politics that does not depend on rage
An intense struggle for control of the House is underway with Rep
Bob Livingston conducting a telephone campaign to replace Rep
Newt Gingrich as speaker and Gingrich fighting with a counter campaign that has given some members pause about ousting him
At the same time a small band of Republicans vowed on Thursday that they would not vote to re elect Gingrich under any circumstances a move that because of the Republicans shrunken House majority could tie the party in knots for months because it could throw the speakership to a Democrat
Rep
Matt Salmon R Ariz said I personally have made the decision that I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker in January and there are six others who have told me they feel the same way seven people who just will not and it takes six to deadlock the vote Fury at the speaker has boiled over since Tuesday s elections when Republicans suffered a net loss of five seats in the House
They blamed Gingrich the party s chief strategist
But many were already angry at him for what they said was his failure to articulate a clear message for the party going into the elections and for a messy budget process that gave President Clinton a political edge and contradicted Republican principles of fiscal conservativism by containing massive amounts of pork spending
House Republicans are to meet Nov
to vote by secret ballot for their leaders
Whoever wins the party s nomination for speaker then stands for election by the full House in January
Even if Gingrich wins the secret ballot he could be denied re election as speaker in January if Salmon and at least five others refuse to vote for him
Because the Republicans now control the House by only seats it would take just six votes against Gingrich to deny him a majority and allow Democrats to potentially elect one of their own as speaker
With such a chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming Livingston told Gingrich that he should step aside for the good of the party according to Republican officials
The officials said that Livingston spoke to Gingrich shortly after the disastrous election returns but also before the election reflecting Livingston s earlier displeasure with the speaker over the budget process
Several Republicans said that both Livingston the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and one of the few members with the stature to stand for speaker and Gingrich were working the phones on Thursday in a struggle for votes
Livingston has said nothing publicly about a challenge to Gingrich but several members and aides said on Thursday that he would announce his intentions possibly as soon as Friday after he had determined if he could win
He won t do it til he has his ducks in a row and right now a lot of people are still loyal to the speaker said an aide to a Republican who like many others is trying to straddle the line between fealty to a speaker who may retain power and encouragement to a challenger who offers a salve to an embattled party
Stunned by the Democratic resurgence in the mid term elections congressional Republicans tore into each other Wednesday over who was to blame for their failure to make the traditional opposition party gains in an off year election
The soul searching and recriminations and a possibility of congressional leadership challenges came as election results showed that Republicans had been unable to increase their hold over the Senate and that Democrats had picked up five seats in the House
The Democratic surge marked the first time since that the president s party had gained seats in a midterm election and it whittled the Republican House majority down to a mere six votes
The Democratic victories were even more remarkable in a political year marked by the months long scandal over President Clinton s affair with Monica Lewinsky
The Republicans new majority assuming a Democrat leading in Oregon holds on to win with one independent amounted to the smallest congressional majority since the Republican controlled Congress of the last time Republicans controlled the House until they captured it again in

But furious rank and file Republicans burned up the phone lines to each other discussing whether to mount leadership challenges in both chambers in the next few weeks
We ve got to reach out and have more than southern white males running the Washington Republican Party said Rep
Joe Scarborough a conservative from Florida
He said that Republicans this year had been left without any accomplishments to run on
We need an agenda first of all he said
We went an entire calendar year without an agenda Rep
Chris Shays a moderate from Connecticut called the election a devastating loss and said simply There are going to be major changes in our leadership
All segments of our party want to see change At the White House Clinton called the election results a vindication of his party s policies
If you look at all the results he said they are clear and unambiguous
The American people want their business their concerns their children their families their future addressed here
That s what the message of the election was One of the first difficult questions now facing Congress is how to proceed with the impeachment inquiry in the face of public resistance to removing Clinton from office and with a Republican majority now so slim that it is almost certain that the votes required for impeachment cannot be assembled
In a public statement released Wednesday Hyde said The Committee continues to have a clear constitutional duty to complete its work in a fair and expeditious manner
Our duty has not changed because the constitution has not changed But Sen
Robert Torricelli D NJ said the election results guaranteed that impeachment will fail
I think any serious effort to remove President Clinton from office is effectively over he said
It is simply for Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott to decide on an exit strategy From the other side of the aisle Rep
Rick Lazio a Long Island Republican said The inquiry should be wrapped up expeditiously fairly and it ought to be resolved in the immediate future For the past year Republicans struggled to keep control of the House with seats and to find consensus among their party s competing factions
With their numbers reduced the Republican leadership will need to carry out a tortuous balancing act to unite a hard core conservative faction that wants a more aggressive social agenda with a bloc of moderates who want their party to return to the center

Seeming uncharacteristically uncertain Wednesday he said he had trouble accounting for the results

Taking his share of the blame for his party s losses the Georgia Republican said he had misjudged how the public would recoil from the Clinton scandal as amplified in the modern media world and how the scandal would drown out other Republican themes
I mean I totally underestimated the degree to which people would just get sick of hour a day talk television and talk radio and then the degree to which this whole scandal became just sort of disgusting by sheer repetition he said
And as a result I think we probably underestimated the need to really aggressively push a much stronger message about cutting taxes and saving Social Security winning the war on drugs reforming education and national defense Majority Leader Sen
Trent Lott of Mississippi also admitted mistakes saying his party had not presented a clear enough message in the final hours of the campaign
He also conceded that Congress final scramble to pass a billion budget bill hurt his party
One of this lessons for Republicans out of this is that we need to listen more carefully to the people and we need to have a clear understanding and concise message that we do apply across the nation he said in Washington
Both Lott and Gingrich said Republicans would put an emphasis next year on tax cutting and shoring up the Social Security system
Even as the two leaders spoke their angry rank and file lawmakers were making phone calls trying to assess whether to mount challenges against the Republican leaders who have steered the Congress since the Republican s assumed control four years ago

Rep
Peter King R NY was one of several members who spoke with Livingston on Thursday
He told me he s making a number of phone calls that he s gotten a very positive response about running for speaker and he ll decide within the next hours King said
He won t do it till he has his ducks in a row and right now a lot of people are still loyal to the speaker said an aide to a Republican who like many others is trying to straddle the line between fealty to a speaker who may retain power and encouragement to a challenger who offers a salve to an embattled party
Many Republicans immediately blamed Gingrich for the party s losses on Tuesday
Talk quickly emerged the next day of a slate of candidates to oppose Gingrich and his lieutenants
The list of possible candidates for leadership positions included Repe Steve Largent of Oklahoma who talked with Livingston on Thursday about challenging Gingrich Republican officials said speaking on the condition that their names not be reported
Those officials said that Largent told Livingston that he wanted to run with him on a ticket and that he would challenge Rep
Dick Armey the majority leader
But these officials said that if Livingston did not challenge Gingrich Largent would run for speaker instead
Other names were floated Wednesday for leadership posts
They included Reps
David McIntosh of Indiana for speaker and Jennifer Dunn of Washington as conference chairman
Added to the mix on Thursday was the name of Rep
Christopher Cox a California conservative
As a sign of the uncertainty prevailing among House members on Thursday Rep
Henry Hyde the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and one of the House s most venerable members rebuffed a chance to endorse Gingrich as speaker
Hyde said that Gingrich bore responsibility for the party s losses Tuesday
Leadership takes credit when things go right he said
They ought to take the blame when things go wrong Asked if Gingrich should remain speaker Hyde said I rather think he will but that remains to be seen The energy that many vented publicly on Wednesday as anger toward Gingrich seemed devoted on Thursday to intense internal political calculations about whether Livingston could succeed in toppling Gingrich and whether he should succeed
While many support him as a veteran who understands the House and has shown shrewd political skills in managing the massive federal budget others are reviving images of the Louisianan as a hot head who gave the party a bad name during the government shutdown two years ago and who tends toward arm flailing in heated moments
One conservative leader said that he and his allies had reservations about Livingston because he was obsessed about trying to keep social issues out of the budget process
The budget he said has been a vehicle for conservatives over the years to add restrictions on federal money for abortion and other things you can t get through the Senate or past a presidential veto
If Livingston is the challenger I doubt that will cause a rallying of the real conservatives in Congress Some moderates said they were prepared to support him
Rep
Marge Roukema R NJ said I would be amenable to Livingston Still she cautioned I m not after Newt
But it s wrong not to sit down and seriously look at our options Ken Johnson an aide to Rep
WJ Billy Tauzin R La said that his boss was emblematic of the confusion among the broad base of House Republicans
Billy has been loyal to both Speaker Gingrich and Dick Armey and he s still loyal to them but he also wants to hear what they have to say before committing to them in the next election Johnson said
Everyone is asking the same question Can we refocus the message and re energize our base without re aligning the leadership Salmon said his refusal to support Gingrich no matter what was based on Gingrich s track record of one failed strategy after another including the impeachment process and the pork laden budget
With the challenge under way Gingrich has been trying to show members that he is responsive to their concerns
After an election night in which he portrayed the Republicans as victorious even as they lost seats the next day he took responsibility for the losses
In another move Gingrich has indicated that he is willing to cede control over the party s congressional campaign committee allowing the whole House to select its members
Gingrich is also making strong personal appeals to Republicans
Said one top House aide He ll get support
How much Only his own vote counters know 
The presidential campaign of began Wednesday like it or not
The millennial election will be fought on a political playing field whose rough outlines if not its exact boundaries were drawn by the voters in Tuesday s elections which delivered a crushing disappointment to the giddy hopes of the Republicans and an unexpected elixir to the recently ailing Democrats
President Clinton called it an astonishing triumph of issues over investigations and said the Democrats had won so many major victories because they had a clear message Republicans agreed
Of course the next months will bring many surprises and many reversals of fortune
But the election results offered important guidelines
Tuesday was a great day for Vice President Al Gore for at least three reasons
He worked furiously and successfully in the last ten days before the balloting to persuade Democratic loyalists not to stay home and sulk appearing on behalf of no fewer than candidates according to his office
A moderate within the spectrum of his own party he watched moderates win crucial elections notably in the California gubernatorial race where Lt
Gov
Gray Davis a cautious pragmatist like Gore won a smashing victory
The returns an even break in the Senate and a Democratic gain of five in the House of Representatives also made the impeachment of President Clinton less likely
And the better shape Clinton is in as his term ends the better chance Gore his sidekick for six years now stands in the presidential nomination process and ultimately the election
But California voters also complicated the nominating process and set Gore strategists to work on tactics to uncomplicate it because he and they consider the state absolutely central to his presidential aspirations
In a referendum in California adopted a primary system under which Republicans Democrats and independent voters would all receive the same ballot with candidates of all parties listed
That violates the rules of both major parties and a measure on the ballot Tuesday Proposition would have rescinded the change
But it failed raising the possibility that California s March primary will be a mere political popularity poll with convention delegates chosen in caucus or convention a nightmare
Tuesday was a bad day for the Republican right
High profile right wingers lost across the country from Attorney General Dan Lungren in the California governor s race to Sen
Lauch Faircloth denied re election in North Carolina to Rep
Mark Neumann of Wisconsin who failed in a Senate race despite a huge spending advantage over Sen
Russell Feingold to Ellen Sauerbrey in Maryland who proved unable on her second try to prevail over an unpopular Democratic governor Parris Glendening
Both conservatives and moderates in the party said the Republicans had to get back to basics
Even Speaker Newt Gingrich conceded that the results should sober every Republican and called for new strategic thinking
If you make it a referendum on a president with a per cent approval rating as they tried to do you shouldn t be surprised if the election goes against you said Gov
Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania a moderate whose promoters mention him weekly as a possible vice presidential nominee
Sen
John McCain of Arizona a conservative who tends to steer away from divisive social issues won re election with per cent of the vote
He is studying the possibility of a presidential race but before he or any other Republican nominee can hope to win he said in an interview Wednesday congressional Republicans and their leaders need to learn some lessons
I just hope this debacle is a wake up call for our people he said
You ve got to be for something smaller government better education something
We re seen as the party that s against everything Polls taken late in this year s campaign bore McCain out
They showed that the Republicans are no longer identified with issues that were once their electoral bread and butter such as low taxes and law and order
Tuesday was also a fresh demonstration for anyone who needed one of the political utility of pitching a tent big enough for almost everyone
Black politicians in North Carolina Maryland and California reported that their fears of an indifferent black turnout had proved groundless
Black votes proved indispensable to a considerable number of hard pressed Democratic candidates especially where they felt their interests directly threatened
The figures on Hispanic voting assembled from exit polls and from the candidates own precinct analyses showed dramatic differences
In California where the outgoing Republican governor Pete Wilson had played the anti immigration card with a vengeance both major Democratic candidates Davis and Sen
Barbara Boxer who won re election after trailing in early polls cleaned up among Hispanic voters
He took percent she 
But both of the Bush brothers Jeb in Florida and George W
in Texas took more than half the Hispanic vote in their highly successful gubernatorial campaigns
So did McCain
Jeb Bush is married to a Hispanic woman he and his brother both speak Spanish fluently and frequently and Senator McCain has long espoused Hispanic causes
Both George W
Bush and McCain will draw strength if they decide to run from their proven ability to appeal to Hispanic voters as well as their general electoral strength
George W
Bush took percent of the vote in Texas where a Democrat sat in the governor s chair only four years ago and which has the second largest bloc of electoral votes
Florida has the fourth largest
Governor Bush of Texas uttered a rallying cry for the moderates
A leader who is compassionate and conservative he said in his victory speech can erase the gender gap and open the Republican party to new faces and new voices But figures on the right saw things differently
James Dobson a leading religious broadcaster said that Republicans had fared poorly because Gingrich and Sen
Trent Lott of Mississippi the majority leader had caved in to the president on the budget and de emphasized social issues such as abortion and flag desecration
He called all but explicitly for the ouster of Gingrich
Likewise the millionaire publisher Steve Forbes another probable candidate in said the leadership will have a lot to answer for Tuesday proved the potency of education as an issue and suggested that it will emerge as a major theme of the campaign
Clinton in his limited involvement in the campaign and Gore in his extensive participation both stressed Democratic programs to build more schools and hire more teachers
Almost a quarter of California voters and there are now almost twice as many voters in California as in any other state named education as their most pressing concern
Elsewhere Democrats won the governorships of Alabama and South Carolina against the odds partly by emphasizing their rivals opposition to lotteries that will help to pay for schools
In Iowa a Democrat was elected governor for the first time since on a platform that featured the dilapidated condition of the state s schools and a promise to remedy it
Tuesday demonstrated the overriding importance of money in modern American politics
Feingold one of the principal backers of campaign finance reform survived to fight another day but so did opponents of reform
And the returns in House races showing that all but six of members who sought re election had won underlined once again how hard it is under the present system for a challenger to raise enough money to compete effectively
The difficulties of raising money may doom many would be presidential candidacies
Gore will have what he needs as will Bush Forbes and former Gov
Lamar Alexander of Tennessee
But how many others will Finally Tuesday delivered an indecisive message about impeachment
Close to two thirds of voters nationwide told exit pollsters that they intended to send no message about Clinton but they made it clear in response to other questions that they disliked the House inquiry into the president s alleged misdeeds and wanted to see it end
In only two states Kansas and Nebraska did a majority of voters say they favored even a congressional censure of Clinton a much milder form of punishment advocated by many Clinton backers
Some Republicans said privately that there should be no hearings at all in the Clinton matter and some Democrats began talking about a deal the equivalent of a plea bargain that would bring the matter to an early close
Nevertheless Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee said they needed to press ahead with the Constitutional process that the House has set in motion
Among those taking that view were Rep
Bob Barr of Georgia a fierce foe of the president and Rep
Mary Bono of California whose tone has been more muted
But Rep
David Dreier of California the incoming Rules Committee chairman said that the election has played a role in ensuring that one of us has a desire to drag that out 
A week after the White House and congressional Democrats disavowed his war on Speaker Newt Gingrich James Carville President Clinton s former campaign strategist and chief outside defender put forth a new battle cry Wednesday He will not be muzzled
Not only that but Carville went beyond his customary denunciations of Gingrich and the Republicans and in an interview trained his fire on leaders in his own party for not being sufficiently aggressive four weeks before Election Day
My sense of frustration is that I believe the Democrats have a much better chance of doing much better than anyone expects Carville said
And I don t think anyone s emerging to try to pull it together
Everybody ought to be pushing the leadership in the Congress the White House the DNC
We ought to hammer Gingrich every day
How can you take the Congress back if you don t make a case against the people who are running it I have never heard of a strategy like that Sounding increasingly agitated he went on The only people left to be activated in this election are Democrats
The right wing they re bouncing off the walls
They re going out to vote Rep
Dick Gephardt the minority leader complained to Erskine Bowles the White House chief of staff after Carville appeared on the NBC News program Meet the Press on Sept
and declared Cpl
Cue Ball Carville will be rolling into battle against Newt Gingrich The concern among House Democrats one expressed by some White House officials as well was that Carville s vitriol would make the Democrats appear overly partisan and could be especially damaging to Democrats in marginal districts who do not want to appear too easy on the president
But on Wednesday Carville was anything but timid
If Gephardt people think they ve quieted me down he said I m not quieted Carville said he told officials at the White House Don t waste your breath about calling me and telling me not to say this Carville insisted that he would rather do battle with Republicans than with his fellow Democrats
If they want to fight with me they can he said
I m going to fight with the Republicans Yet he could not help but ridicule his party
Asked to describe the Democrats strategy for the election Carville said If there is one no one s shared it with me 
This is what Newt Gingrich is supposed to do well
The planning
The strategy
The big picture
The vision
His vision brought the GOP to the majority in Congress in and made him the first Republican House Speaker in years
But by his own admission Gingrich s vision seems to have blurred this time around costing Republicans a net of five seats in Tuesday s election and leaving the party s narrow governing majority even narrower
The disappointing election results also left Gingrich open to a fractious challenge for his post as speaker
Members and aides said Wednesday that a fury at the speaker had bubbled up overnight and that some members were trying to organize a slate of candidates to replace Gingrich and his leadership team when House Republicans convene on Nov
to select their leaders for next year
As Rep
Mark Sanford R SC put it When a company s stock price goes down it s usually the CEO who gets fired Top Republican aides speaking anonymously were even blunter
People were very angry last night one aide said
Today it s a mixture of seething and dismay
It s just ugly
And Newt knows it
His career is on the line Another aide said Most people are really angry with Newt and no one knows what to do with it
But some are dipping their toe in the water and seeing what the temperature is A possible slate could contain the names of Reps
Robert L
Livingston of Louisiana to replace Gingrich Steve Largent of Oklahoma to replace Dick Armey of Texas as majority leader and Jennifer Dunn of Washington to replace John A
Boehner of Ohio as conference chairman
Rep
David M
McIntosh of Indiana is also said to be considering a run for speaker but it was not clear whether he would be part of any slate
Rep
Tom DeLay of Texas the majority whip was said to be secure
Armey bluntly acknowledged the scramble going on in the wings to oust the leadership
Told on Nightline that there were Republicans after his head Armey replied They re welcome to it if they re big enough to take it Publicly Gingrich has expressed confidence about keeping his job as speaker
But he has been grim faced over the last hours and closeted himself Wednesday with his top strategists making calls to shore up his support among members
He looks like the victim of an accident said Rep
Peter King R NY who supports Gingrich
He s very somber in tone The question as it always is with Gingrich is how many members are prepared to rebel against his leadership
In the past no more than a couple of dozen members have openly expressed their dissatisfaction with him and a coup attempt last year fizzled for lack of support
I m hoping more people will understand the need for a serious reassessment this year said Rep
Charles T
Canady R Fla who said he had hoped for a challenge to the speaker after the elections when the Republicans also lost seats
The reality is this Our majority keeps shrinking Canady said
If it shrinks any more it will be gone But Gingrich has built support among moderates and some perceived the election as a repudiation of the conservatives
Rep
Sherwood L
Boehlert R Utah said the results showed that this was the right direction for the party
To maintain our majority we ve got to moderate some of our views Boehlert said
Thomas Mann a Congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution said that moderates supported Gingrich in part because no appealing alternative had emerged
They know he sees the broader world and is prepared to moderate if it makes sense Mann said
Newt s gone out of his way to support the moderates
He s nurtured a relationship with them But Mann and others said that anger has been building at Gingrich for several reasons including his signing on to a budget deal last month that seemed to capitulate to President Clinton not offering a clear legislative agenda for Republicans and not communicating a clear political message
We are most defined by who we hate said Rep
Mark Souder R Ind
But voters are more sophisticated than that and Republicans better have something to say about where we re going The anger grew in the last few days when the speaker approved a million anti Clinton advertising campaign that allowed Democrats to turn the election into a referendum on Gingrich who has never been nearly as popular with the public as Clinton has been
As if only slowly absorbing the implications of the loss the speaker seemed unable at a news conference here Wednesday morning to pinpoint why the party suffered a net drop of five seats in the House
As late as Tuesday afternoon he was predicting a net pickup of between and 
Until we look at it better I frankly don t understand all the things that happened yesterday he said and I m not sure anybody else in the country does either But he said Republicans should have maniacally focused on a basic message of cutting taxes saving Social Security and preventing drug abuse and campaigned aggressively on those themes
He contrasted the lack of focus this year with the Contract With America that proved so successful in 
People thought we stood for something pretty big he said
But Gingrich also seemed aware of the mounting concern about his leadership repeatedly casting the election results as a victory for his leadership team because Republicans had stayed in the majority for three elections in a row for the first time in years
He also suggested that those who would challenge him have little support
The people who normally are quoted on this are people who would in fact take the party to a narrower base Gingrich said referring to the periodic eruptions of concern among conservatives about his leadership
I d like to see who it was that had a plan that they were confident over the last days would have been more successful and why they didn t share it 
House Speaker Newt Gingrich who orchestrated the Republican revolution of recent years and is overseeing the impeachment inquiry into President Clinton was driven from office Friday by a party that swiftly turned on him after its unexpected losses in Tuesday s midterm elections
Catching virtually everyone on Capitol Hill by surprise Gingrich announced Friday night in two conference calls to other Republicans that he would not seek re election as Speaker in the Nov
vote and would leave Congress altogether when his term expires in January
This will give us a chance to purge some of the poison that is in the system Gingrich said according to a party aide who listened to one of the calls
Gingrich s resignation was a stunning reversal for one of the most combative and personally confrontational politicians in America
He made his name a decade ago by bringing down one Democratic speaker Jim Wright and continued his assaultive style through Tuesday s elections with last minute commercials reminding voters of the Clinton scandal
His reflexive pugilistic response was evident even Friday night
In his second conference call according to several people who listened Gingrich blamed House conservatives for his downfall
Although it was their revolutionary zeal he harnessed to take control of Congress in they have become his most bitter critics in the last two years of his tumultuous speakership
Friday night he called them cannibals who had blackmailed him into quitting
Rep
Michael P
Forbes R NY said Newt said all those who had marginalized the Republican Party had engaged in cannibalism
He said Refer to the clips He s blaming others Another Republican described the conference call this way He started off very statesmanlike but then you could see the anger building
When someone asked him why he was leaving he said A handful of members have blackmailed the conference He said They re hateful And he said They re cannibals Gingrich announced his move just hours after Rep
Robert L
Livingston of Louisiana announced he was running for speaker putting himself forward as a pragmatist and a manager
After the Gingrich calls Rep
Bill Archer of Texas announced he was considering his own run for speaker
Livingston and Archer are chairmen of the two most powerful committees in the House
In a statement Gingrich said The Republican conference needs to be unified and it is time for me to move forward He said he hoped his colleagues would pick a successor who can both reconcile and discipline who can work together and communicate effectively Referring to his wife he told his colleagues he was resigning from Congress because Marianne and I are tired
We need time off to get to know each other again He also acknowledged his own knack for bringing negative attention to himself and his party
If I stay he told his colleagues Friday night my controversial nature would overshadow any successes we might have an understatement to those who recalled his suggestion two years ago that he forced a shutdown of the government because he was miffed about having to sit in the back of Air Force One on a trip with President Clinton
According to another Republican who took notes Gingrich said of his resignation There is a lot of bitterness amongst some of the members
So long as I am around I will always be a target in the news media which would mean we would never be able to get our message out Clinton said Newt Gingrich has been a worthy adversary leading the Republican Party to a majority in the House and joining me in a great national debate over how best to prepare America for the st century
Despite our profound differences I appreciate those times we were able to work together in the national interest especially Speaker Gingrich s strong support for America s continuing leadership for freedom peace and prosperity in the world Many Republicans took the opportunity to portray Gingrich as a visionary
Rep
Sherwood Boehlert of New York said that during the first conference call there was shock and surprise and strong expressions of appreciation for leading us to the Promised Land His supporters said Gingrich had the votes to win the election to nominate a speaker which is to be conducted by secret ballot
But they agreed the party s slim six vote majority meant every vote would be a battle
Kenneth Duberstein a former official in the Reagan administration said I have no doubt he had the votes to be speaker but I m not sure he had the votes to govern He said that because of the deep rifts in the party Gingrich would not have been able to implement his plans
In an unusually biting reaction Rep
Dick Gephardt of Missouri the Democratic leader said he hoped that Gingrich s resignation would clear the fierce partisan air that he had fostered
I hope that whoever succeeds Newt Gingrich as speaker will immediately begin the process of repairing the damage that was wrought on this institution over the last four years Gephardt said
House Republicans predicted that Gingrich s resignation would set off a more wide ranging and hectic scramble to replace him than had been anticipated
There will be a lot of pretenders to the throne who will test the waters said Boehlert who had supported Gingrich for re election as speaker
There won t be any shortage of candidates
