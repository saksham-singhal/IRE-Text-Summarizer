In the nation EU as a whole inflation fell to percent in November compared to percent in the United States and percent in Japan
Germany France Italy Spain the Netherlands Belgium Austria Portugal Finland Ireland and Luxembourg are set to adopt the euro as a common currency at midnight on New Year s Eve
The latest figures may hint at trouble ahead for the euro zone with significant increases over the year in Portugal and Ireland
With the European Central Bank setting a common interest rate for the whole bloc some economists fear the low rate designed to boost core EU economies like France and Germany may bring overheating in smaller nations with faster growth
There was good news for Greece which was kept out of the euro zone for failing to meet economic conditions for joining including low inflation
It s rate was percent in November down from percent a year before
Greece hops to join the euro zone in 
Denmark Sweden and Britain decided to stay out of the euro for political reasons
Eurostat gave the following rates for November with November in brackets Sweden France Germany Austria Luxembourg Belgium percent Denmark Netherlands Finland Britain Spain Italy Portugal Ireland Greece 
Two days before the new euro currency goes into effect for European Union members a growing number of Danes believe their country should take part according to a poll published Tuesday
The survey by the Megaphone polling institute said percent of the people surveyed favor Denmark s participation while percent oppose that
The remaining percent were undecided
The poll conducted Dec
was broadcast by TV channel
Denmark is one of four EU countries staying out of the monetary union for the time being
After voters in rejected the Maastricht treaty that established the system Denmark won opt out clauses
The treaty then was approved
Danish voters traditionally have been lukewarm supporters of the EU
Although many politicians support the unified currency they have been wary about bringing the issue to voters again
A poll published last October showed percent of Danes favored the single currency while percent were opposed
It would take another national referendum for Denmark to adopt the new currency
The government has said it has no plans to hold a referendum before the year 
In a surprise move nations adopting the new European currency the euro dropped key interest rates Thursday effectively setting the rate that will be adopted throughout the euro zone on Jan
Ten of the countries adopting the euro dropped their interest rate to percent
Italy dropped to percent from percent
The coordinated move was a key step in preparing for economic union
Setting a common interest rates had been a particularly contentious issue as center left governments in Germany and France pressed for lower rates to help boost growth and cut unemployment a stubborn percent in the euro zone
European Central Bank chief Wim Duisenberg gave no hint of the rate cuts during a speech in Brussels earlier Thursday instead suggesting that governments should reform rigid labor markets to create jobs
In Germany the biggest economy in the future euro zone central bankers cut the key interest rate to percent from percent
Rates before the cuts had varied throughout the future currency zone from percent in Ireland to percent in Austria
The European Central Bank said in a statement from its Frankfurt headquarters that the move was decided during a meeting Tuesday of its the policy making governing council
The governing council comprises the heads of national central banks plus a six member directorate including the bank president Duisenberg
The joint reduction in interest rates has to be seen as a de facto decision on the level of interest rates with which the bank will start monetary union the statement said adding the percent rate would be maintained for the foreseeable future In Germany central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said the move reflected the worsening outlook for European economies and wasn t a capitulation to political pressure Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine
It s not a dramatic step
It wasn t in response to political pressure Tietmeyer said referring to Germany s cut
The coordinated rate cut could lead to a reduction in the current pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence he said
But Tietmeyer head of the bank on which the ECB is modeled promised that the rate cut does not signal the start of a volatile monetary policy
It s not a shift from the Bundesbank s steady hand policy he said
Growth in Europe has been hit by the Asian and Russian economic crises and turbulence on international financial markets
Duisenberg has said growth in the euro area countries next year will be about percent lower than the percent predicted earlier
In his most candid remarks yet on the economy European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Friday that growth appears to be slowing in the countries adopting the EU common currency or euro on Jan
Despite an area wide survey that suggested a moderation in the pace of growth Duisenberg said domestic demand will continue to boost the economy
He pointed also to a gradual improvement in labor market conditions as supporting growth as well as interest rate cuts toward the percent level of the euro zone s lowest rate countries
Duisenberg who spoke at an event in London said the Dec
and Dec
meetings of the Central Bank s policy making body will gauge the outlook for inflation and the EU economy
The bank which will set monetary policy for the currency bloc has been under pressure from politicians to keep interest rates low to help boost growth and create jobs
While inflation is at its lowest levels in decades just percent in the euro zone unemployment in the nations remains stubbornly high at percent
Struggling to avoid being sidelined in the Continent wide equities market promised by Europe s soon to be introduced single currency French authorities said Thursday that the Paris stock exchange would join an alliance between London and Frankfurt that is seen as the precursor of a pan European market
The Bourse in Paris also announced that it would play host to a meeting Nov
of nine other European exchanges to discuss the steps and conditions needed to create a unifying and competitive pan European equity market The two announcements show how the introduction of the currency the euro is reshaping Europe s financial landscape requiring Europeans to think in Continental rather than national terms in finance and business
And it suggested that exchange authorities in Paris ruffled by the announcement in July of a strategic alliance between the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Borse in Frankfurt had not only abandoned an effort to set up a rival market but were also seeking to gain the initiative by organizing the Nov
gathering
Some doubt remained however about the timing and technicalities of the French entry into the alliance
Foreign Minister Dominique Strauss Kahn said Paris is joining this alliance with the creation from January of a joint company However officials in London and Frankfurt who welcomed the idea in principle declined to say whether the timing and the arrangements were as far advanced as Strauss Kahn implied
I m afraid I can t confirm anything like that a spokeswoman at the London Stock Exchange said
The appearances are well ahead of the reality at this point said an American banker who spoke on the condition of anonymity
Not only that the notion of a Europe wide exchange raises technical questions about the compatibility not just of trading systems but also of the regulations governing stock market operations in the countries that will use the euro beginning in January
That has led some analysts to forecast that a pan European exchange could not be up and running before 
There are an awful lot of issues to be resolved the American banker said
The euro is to be introduced for electronic trading of equities bonds and futures and for intergovernmental transfers
Notes and coins the pocket money that shoppers and travelers will carry will be introduced only in 
Initially the currency will group European nations in a euro zone leaving Britain Denmark Sweden and Greece on the outside
With its concentration of banking and trading however London is expected to continue as the main market center
The prospect has heightened pressure for consolidation among exchanges
Stock market officials in Milan Madrid Amsterdam and Brussels have indicated they would be interested in joining the London Frankfurt alliance which will initially create a single point of liquidity for trading in British and German blue chip issues
The London exchange estimates that a pan European stock exchange would group together companies with a market capitalization of trillion compared with trillion on the New York Stock Exchange
The Paris Bourse the third largest of the European exchanges and the last major holdout toward a pan European market said that it had also invited officials from exchanges in Zurich and Stockholm to attend the Nov
meeting
A spokeswoman said officials from the London Stock Exchange would be at the meeting
Also Thursday the New York Mercantile Exchange and the International Petroleum Exchange here acknowledged that they were considering a merger that would bring together the two biggest energy futures markets
Discussions began in July and the exchanges have formed a working group to study a merger
They already cooperate in the development of a system intended to coordinate after hours electronic trading
China made trading in the euro official Monday announcing authorization for the European common currency s use in trade and financial dealings starting Jan
The expected announcement from the central People s Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange carried by the official Xinhua News Agency also authorized the opening of euro accounts
Financial institutions enterprises and individuals in China can accept and use the euro in economic trade and financial exchanges with members of the European Union effective January Xinhua reported
In addition they can convert use and open the euro accounts it said
Chinese officials have said the government may convert a proportion of its dlrs billion worth of foreign exchange reserves into the euro after the currency s Jan
debut
The countries launching the common currency are Austria Belgium Ireland Italy Finland France Germany Luxembourg the Netherlands Spain and Portugal
Palm Pilot in one hand cellular phone in the other Jean Marc Routiers was juggling business calls halfway between London and Paris
When his phone went dead as the high speed Eurostar train pulled into the underwater tunnel that links England to the Continent the London based French banker loosened his Italian silk tie and introduced himself
I definitely describe myself as a European he said in the fluent English he perfected working at an Australian bank
I may get sentimental when they play the Marseillaise but for all the practical things I see myself as a citizen of Europe
I like the lifestyle in France but I don t make my living there The year is the official start up date of the euro the common European currency that will unite countries monetarily
But throughout Europe a different kind of integration has already taken root
Routiers who was spending a day in Paris to meet with his bank s French clients is at the vanguard of a new generation of Europeans who do not have to brace themselves for a shock in the new year
Mobile fluent in several languages and aggressively non nationalistic they are already living the kind of borderless cosmopolitan existence that the single European currency is supposed to advance
They do not share their parents memories of World War II or their parents sense of national identity
People worry when they hear talk of a common European defense policy because it suggests that at the end of the day we have one government said Kleon Papadopoulos a Greek banker based in London
Countries are afraid to lose their sovereignty but I don t see it as a bad thing
If a government is good stable and efficient who cares if it is based in Berlin or Athens Papadopoulos who studied business in the United States and Britain could serve as a model for the new Europeans
He works for a Swiss bank in London speaks Greek English and French and in the past year has traveled among other places to Belgium the United States Cuba Switzerland and Italy
Like hundreds of thousands of other Europeans he chose London and its busy financial markets as the best place to work
He said he does not feel as if he lives in England
He lives in London the clubhouse of financial Europe
And membership has its privileges
Papadopoulos lives in the fashionable Knightsbridge area drives a Porsche he bought in Brussels and works out at the fashionable gym of the Carleton Towers
I went to the London School of Economics in and the only other foreigners I met were from the Middle East he says
Now friends and co workers are Italian French Greek Spanish German even Russian
You feel it everywhere
The streets are jammed with foreigners
Not tourists people who live and work here Baby boomers in Europe often describe themselves as the generation weaned on the protest and social turmoil that convulsed European societies years ago
Less dramatic but equally significant was a law guaranteeing freedom of movement within what were then the six countries of the Common Market
A Frenchman could work in Holland an Italian could work in Germany without a permit
Back then some economists dourly predicted huge migrations particularly of unskilled laborers moving from southern countries to the more prosperous north
Actually as huge industries like steel shrank in the s and s so did the job opportunities for working class Europeans
There are countries within what is now the European Union but only a small percentage of their citizens have moved to other countries according to estimates prepared by Eurostat
Those who do mostly find jobs in the service industry as waiters maids or garbage collectors
There are still legal barriers preventing most doctors lawyers and academics from finding work in other countries
So far the European Union has been most profitably put to use by white collar business executives who eagerly followed career opportunities across national borders time zones and language barriers
Twenty five years ago that kind of mobility was the preserve of a far smaller elite the top executives of major companies or multinational corporations
Technology from high speed trains to the ever evolving apparatus of business lap top computers cell phones fax machines has made European mobility accessible to mid level managers young entrepreneurs and even students
Cable television which allows Germans to watch Italian game shows or Swedes to watch French news programs has spread the Zeitgeist to the masses
This year Superga an Italian brand of sports clothes and shoes opened a major advertising campaign with a series of magazine ads that show fashionable young people saucily cavorting with European leaders a leggy young woman pushes her bicycle up the steps of the Elysee Palace to greet President Jacques Chirac a young man playfully sticks his tongue out the window of the plane of the former German chancellor Helmut Kohl
This kind of ad would not have been possible five or years ago said Aldo Cernuto executive creative director of the Milan office of Pirella Gottsche Lowe an international advertising agency
Now European unification is on the TV all the time it has seeped into people s unconscious
Even people who do not care about politics recognize the faces of a Tony Blair or Jacques Chirac
Ten years ago very few people did According to the European Union Britain has twice as many EU citizens as France but it is not the country with the highest concentration of residents from other European countries
According to estimates based on surveys prepared by Eurostat nearly a third of the residents of tiny Luxembourg which has low unemployment and a high standard of living are from other European countries
Belgium which has the European Commission and NATO headquarters is second with percent
Paradoxically perhaps Britain the one major European nation that has held off from joining the euro is widely viewed as the nerve center of the new cosmopolitanism headquarters for the New Europeans bankers and business executives drawn by London s financial district a more flexible bureaucracy and the universality of the English language
Perhaps just as surprisingly London also serves as an example of another less obvious aspect of European cosmopolitanism the breakdown of certain social barriers
Studying abroad was once a privilege reserved to the sons and daughters of Europe s elite
Now the European Union has a year old scholarship program called Socrates Erasmus that this year allowed European university students percent of the EU s entire university population to study in other countries within the Union for up to a year free
In the last years business schools in Europe have multiplied and most offer US style MBA programs that teach an American approach to business
This too has allowed a measure of meritocracy to creep into European business
Juergen Schrempp the head of Daimler started as a car mechanic noted Stephen Szabo a professor of European Affairs at the Johns Hopkins University School for International Studies in Washington
That would have been unthinkable in Germany years ago Social mobility moreover is fueled by movement
When people transfer to another country they find it easier to shed the psychological or cultural trappings of home
I could never have the kind of job I have had I stayed in Paris Routier explained
France is still very hierarchical
Bosses want to know where you went to school what your father does
In London none of that matters as long as you make money Many Britons still view their country as weighed down by heavy class distinctions
For example Tony Smith editor of several Portuguese magazines in Lisbon seized an opportunity to study in Vienna years ago and never looked back
He has lived all over Europe and is fluent in Portuguese Spanish German French and Serbo Croatian
His father a car mechanic had not traveled out of Britain until 
Smith said he could never have succeeded as well had he stayed home
I didn t go to public schools or Oxbridge he explained
I m not saying its impossible but it would have been much more difficult in England Yet Continental Europeans who flock to London find themselves bypassing English society and joining a cosmopolitan world where birth and breeding do not matter as much
Ildiko Iliffe chose to work in London to escape the sexism she encountered on the Continent
Mrs Iliffe who is Hungarian speaks fluent English German French and Italian and met her Canadian husband Roger Iliffe while both were attending the University of Bocconi business school in Milan in 
Like his wife Iliffe speaks four languages and has lived and traveled all over the world
She works on the Eastern European desk of a British bank he works for a major international consulting firm
Originally they planned to work in Italy but Mrs Iliffe said the prevailing attitude towards working women there made it impossible for her to find as good a job
I went to job interviews at Italian banks and they only asked me about my husband s job she said with a grimace
And they made it clear that they were afraid I would get pregnant and ask for maternity leave Philippe Haspeslagh a professor at Insead the prestigious international business school in Fontainebleau outside Paris called Mrs Iliffe s choices cherry picking choosing the best deal for herself
As he put it If they cannot find what they want in one country they can pick up and seek it elsewhere Twenty five years ago Haspeslagh was a pioneer when he did the same thing
A Belgian who studied business at Harvard he lives and teaches in France and does consulting work all over Europe from Sweden to the Czech Republic
The message on his cell phone is in three languages French Flemish and English
His students a generation behind him see nothing exceptional in his transnationalism
These Europeans form an advance guard that is still relatively small in numbers but experts say they carry a disproportionate influence on their societies
In Germany for example it is the business people who are pushing ahead with change and pulling politicians along behind them kicking and screaming Szabo said
They are looking at a larger market and feel the competitive pressures of globalization
Politicians are responding to a domestic constituency
They are answering to an international one 
Making their first collective decision about monetary policy the European nations launching a common currency on Jan
cut interest rates Thursday in a surprise move that won market confidence
Ten of the countries joining European economic union dropped their key interest rate to percent with Portugal making the most significant plunge from percent
Austria made the smallest cut from percent
The exception was Italy which cut from to percent
It is expected to drop to the common rate by the time the euro is launched
Unifying the interest rate is a critical step in laying the groundwork for monetary union and analysts generally expected rates to settle at around the level of Germany s percent before the cut now percent
However interest rate levels had become a contentious political issue with center left governments in Germany and France pushing for rate cuts to help spur growth and combat unemployment stuck at percent in the nations adopting the euro
The head of the European Central Bank that will set monetary policy for the euro nations Wim Duisenberg again on Thursday suggested governments should reform rigid labor markets to create jobs and not pressure him to cut rates
The remarks in Brussels before the cuts were made gave no hint that a rate drop was imminent but made clear his resistance to political pressure was as strong as ever
So strong in fact that Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said he had feared the bank would delay the decision
What had been feared was that in order to prove its independence the ECB would go against its own analysis and would wait longer which would have been nonsensical Zalm said
Hans Tietmeyer who runs the German Bundesbank on which the ECB is modeled hinted the rate cut was designed to boost confidence in the new currency dampened by global economic crises and Europe s worsening outlook
The coordinated rate cut could lead to a reduction in the current pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence Tietmeyer said
The cuts seemed to have the desired impact
Frankfurt s main index closed up percent while France s was up percent
The cuts also boosted markets in Spain Belgium Italy and even Britain which is not among the nations launching the euro
The reaction is Oh good they re doing a little bit to prop up the euro economy But confidence has taken quite a hit across Europe recently and I think further action from the ECB will be needed next year maybe down to percent James Mitchell senior London based strategist with Nomura
An economist at the Banque Bruxelles Lambert Liesbeth Van de Craen said the cuts were timely
We are clearly headed for a slowdown she said
Until recently Europe s economies had held out relatively well against damage from Asia and Russia s economic crises and unstable financial markets
But just two days ago Duisenberg painted the bleakest picture yet of Europe s economies warning growth will likely slow to percent next year from earlier expectations of percent
The rate cuts may help
By making it cheaper to borrow money rate cuts can lead to more investment and new businesses making it less worthwhile to save and inducing people to spend
That expands the economy
The countries launching the euro are Austria Belgium Ireland Italy Finland France Germany Luxembourg the Netherlands Spain and Portugal
Wim Duisenberg the head of the new European Central Bank said in an interview published Wednesday that he won t step down after completing half his term as earlier agreed
I had hoped you wouldn t ask me that question
The answer is no Duisenberg told the Le Monde daily which had asked him if he would step down after four years on the job
Duisenberg was named this spring as head of the new European Central Bank which will govern the policies of the euro the new single currency which goes into effect Jan
France surprised its euro partners by proposing its central banker Jean Claude Trichet at the last minute for the job Duisenberg was expected to secure easily
Although he was elected easily Duisenberg agreed to step down after four years of his eight year term although he has since said no such gentleman s agreement exists
Duisenberg told Le Monde a newspaper that fervently has backed the euro that the the introduction of the new currency is the most significant step so far toward European unification
However he said that he would like to see further political integration especially in the area of foreign tax and social policies
Europe s dream of monetary union becomes reality Thursday when nations irrevocably lock their currencies together to form the euro and create an economic giant whose boundaries stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the shores of the Mediterranean
The euro s birth is being hailed as a historic turning point in international finance and is arguably the greatest single step in the drive to create a united Europe from the ruins of World War II
This Dec
will be one of the great dates in the history of the th century French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss Kahn told France Info radio
It s the beginning of a new era On what Europeans are calling E day economic and finance ministers from the nations will huddle at European Union headquarters to agree to the rates at which German marks Italian lire and the rest are absorbed into euro
Strauss Kahn said the euro would likely be worth to French francs
