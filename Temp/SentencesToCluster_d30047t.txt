Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station the Russian made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle
Stacking the two giant cylinders miles above the Earth was considered the most difficult part of the mission
The job fell to Nancy Currie the shuttle crane operator who had deftly hoisted and repositioned Unity in the cargo bay on Saturday
The two station pieces are so big feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined mass of pounds that Currie and her crewmates were going to have to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views rather than direct line of sight
Such a blind docking had never been attempted before
Mission Control gave the astronauts plenty of time for the tasks
The main thing I ve tried to do for the last two years working on this flight is make sure we have time
We have margin on everything said flight director Bob Castle
Before beginning their final approach to Zarya Russian for Sunrise the shuttle s six astronauts had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launched last month from California
Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbiting debris
The smaller gap would have been probably a little too close for comfort Mission Control said
The bigger worry by far was over Endeavour s pursuit and capture of Zarya and its coupling with Unity
The shuttle s foot robot arm had never before been assigned to handle an object as massive as the pound Zarya a power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakhstan on Nov
It will provide all the necessary electricity and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launched next summer
The foot pound Unity will serve as a connecting passageway or vestibule for future modules
In case Zarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot arm two spacewalking astronauts would have to manually fit them together
The astronauts would be going out anyway Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two components
In all three spacewalks were planned for Endeavour s day flight
NASA estimates more launches and more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex
Once completed the nation space station will have a mass of million pounds be longer than a football field and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts
Endeavour s astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station on Sunday creating a seven story tower in the shuttle cargo bay
It was the first time that the Russian built Zarya control module and the made in America Unity chamber had ever touched
It looked to be a perfect and hopefully long lasting fit
We have capture of Zarya commander Robert Cabana announced the two pieces came together
Congratulations to the crew of the good ship Endeavour replied Mission Control
That s terrific The mile high construction job began two hours earlier with Nancy Currie s capture of Zarya Russian for Sunrise using the shuttle robot arm
We re halfway home Cabana said
Then came the hard part stacking the two giant cylinders in the cargo bay
The two station pieces are so big feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined mass of pounds that Currie and her crewmates had to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views rather than direct line of sight
This was the first time such a blind docking had ever been attempted
Currie positioned the solar winged Zarya still on the end of the shuttle robot arm several inches directly above Unity
It was slow going she wanted and needed perfect alignment
Once she was sure she had it Cabana fired Endeavour s thrusters and the brief burst raised the shuttle and thereby Unity enough for the docking mechanisms on the two station components to snap together
The historical moment occurred above the South Pacific
The union intended to last the station s year or more lifetime set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two components
Mission Control thought Sunday s work might take hours longer than planned and gave the six astronauts plenty of time for the tasks
But everything occurred more or less when and how it was supposed to aside from a piece of space junk that strayed too close
Before beginning their final approach to Zarya the six astronauts had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launched last month from California
Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbiting debris
The smaller gap would have been probably a little too close for comfort Mission Control said
The bigger worry by far was over Endeavour s pursuit and capture of Zarya and its coupling with Unity
The shuttle s foot robot arm had never before handled an object as massive as the foot pound Zarya a power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakstan on Nov
It will provide all of the necessary electricity and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launched next summer
Minutes after Zarya s capture Cabana called down that two antennas on the module were still undeployed as Russian flight controllers had feared
The antennas must be fully deployed in order for Zarya s manual docking system to work that system won t be needed before next summer officials said
The only other problem was with a Zarya battery the astronauts took up a replacement part
The foot pound Unity the first American made component will serve as a connecting passageway or vestibule for future modules
It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined if they could not be connected with the robot arm NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronauts to manually fit them together
In all three spacewalks are planned for Endeavour s day flight not only to hook up electrical connections between the two modules but to install handrails and other tools for future crews
The joined modules will be released from Endeavour once all of the work is completed
NASA estimates more launches and more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex
Once completed the nation space station will have a mass of million pounds be longer than a football field and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts
WASHINGTON NASA and the Russian Space Agency have agreed to set aside a last minute Russian request to launch an international space station into an orbit closer to Mir officials announced Friday
While putting the new station closer to Russia s year old Mir station would make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies from the old outpost to the new one the request came too late to be acted on said Randy Brinkley NASA s space station program manager
NASA was surprised last week when Russia s prime station contractor proposed the orbital position change just two and a half weeks before launch of the first part of the new station
Delaying the Nov
flight by hours to match the orbits would have forced similar shifts in the subsequent assembly flights and resulted in potentially unfavorable sun angles on the solar powered station engineers said
We have mutually concluded that it would not be prudent to make these changes Brinkley said during a news conference held at the Johnson Space Center in Houston
It added technical complexity and risks to the mission that were not justified The decision which followed frank and candid discussions between the two partners was not imposed by the United States he said
The conclusions were mutual Brinkley said
Both sides concluded that it did not make sense The Russians struggling to find money for their space program with their nation in economic collapse had said they wanted to transfer thousands of pounds of newer equipment and scientific instruments from Mir as an economy move
However some critics questioned the Russians motives wondering if the requested orbital change was part of plan to delay the decommissioning and destruction of Mir which the Russians have agreed to do next summer
The Russians have so little money that the United States and other partners in the international station fear that money spent on Mir will prevent Russia from meeting its obligations with the new project
The Mir competes with the international space station for very critical resources and for funding Brinkley said
NASA will consider ideas for salvaging Mir s research equipment to use on the international space station he said but only if it does not interfere with assembling the new station
The United States and other nations plan to begin building the new station in orbit next week when the Russians launch a module that will supply power and propulsion during the early stages of the five year construction period
The space shuttle Endeavor is to follow on Dec
with the second station part a US built connecting passageway that attaches to the first module
The first part of the international space station was smoothly orbiting Earth on Friday after a faultless launch that marked the start of a new age in space exploration and colonization
A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the module into its initial orbit kilometers miles above the Earth and the unit was operating as planned officials said
Russia s Zarya or Sunrise module is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavour which is to be launched Dec
carrying the Unity connecting module
Space officials from nations taking part in the project cheered as the rocket soared into the cloudy sky above the central Asian steppe from the Baikonur launch pad Friday a year later than planned
During the pickup th pvs
A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the first part of the international space station into orbit Friday heralding the start of a new era in international space colonization
Russian space officials and others cheered as ground control announced that the capsule had separated from its booster rocket and reached its first orbit at about kilometers miles above the Earth
Success shouted one exultant official some minutes after the giant rocket blasted off and entered orbit
The heads of the space agencies of nations participating in the project watched the lift off from a distance of about kilometers miles 
Strategic Rocket Forces troops who had prepared the launch were in underground bunkers to avoid poisoning by the highly toxic rocket fuel
Russian and US officials said the launch was flawless and the module performed well during initial tests
They cautioned that much work remains to be done to get the ambitious space station project up and working
Now we only have launches to go about hours of space walks and countless problems but because of the trust and mutual respect the international space station is going to be a reality NASA chief Daniel Goldin told a press conference after the launch
His Russian counterpart Yuri Koptev said the launch was a vital vindication for the troubled Russian space industry proving it could play a major role in space operations
Today we made a truly epoch making step to carry out this project
The Russian space industry is alive and well and is perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station he said
The launch went smoothly with the rocket soaring into the cloudy sky above the central Asian steppes
The huge roar of the rocket reverberated for dozens of kilometers miles across the empty plain around the base
The mood at the launch pad was tense before the launch with space officials and workers anxiously making last minute checks to ensure there were no problems
Solar power panels on the module were successfully deployed shortly after it reached its first orbit and all systems were working normally officials said
The launch of the Russian cargo module which had been delayed for more than a year ushers in a new era of cooperation among former space race rivals
Space officials expressed optimism that cooperation would further promote world stability following the end of the Cold War
We still have some contradictions we still have combat missiles aimed at each other but the predominant trend is the state of cooperation and doing things together said Yuri Semyonov of Russia s Energia space company
The meter feet Zarya or Sunrise was launched by a three stage Proton booster rocket
Zarya is designed to serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the project providing propulsion power and communications
Engineers finished final preparations early Friday for the liftoff of the ton module
The rocket blasted off under cloudy skies and strong winds and disappeared behind the clouds seconds later
The international space station the US led successor to Russia s beleaguered Mir involves nations and is due to be completed by 
It will consist of more than elements that will take assembly flights to complete
Russia s crucial participation has been hampered by the country s financial problems
The launch of the first segment was postponed repeatedly mainly because the chronically broke Russian space agency couldn t afford to complete another part of the station that is to go up later
Zarya is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavor which is to be launched Dec
carrying the Unity connecting module
The space station will not be inhabitable until at least early following the launch of a Russian crew module which is set to blast off next July or August
The space station is expected to cost at least dlrs billion with the United States planning to pay dlrs billion
It will serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for at least years
Russia has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines for constructing the crew module putting the whole project behind schedule
Having lost hope of getting promised government funds the Russian space agency has sold research time on the station to NASA for dlrs million to complete the segment
Russia rents the Baikonur launching pad from Kazakstan
Russian space experts were making final preparations Thursday at the Baikonur rocket base to launch the first component of a multibillion dollar international space station after a year of delay
Built by a Russian company and to be launched atop a Russian booster rocket the ton Zarya Sunrise control and cargo module is a US funded component of the station
It will serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the project providing propulsion power and communications
The unmanned launch set for Moscow time GMT Friday from Baikonur in Kazakhstan has been delayed for one year mainly because of the cash strapped Russian space agency s failure to complete another part of the station
After years of discussing planning and replanning we are about to launch hardware Gretchen McClain deputy associate administrator for the new station said at a news conference earlier this week
We are ready to begin a project that will bring us into the millennium with women and men living and working in space permanently Russian officials added their traditional note of superstition
It is not in the Russian tradition to preface a launch with some advance statements
I would like to knock on wood which is rather common in the Russian tradition said Alexander Krasnov a deputy chief of Russian Space Agency s manned flight department
The station involving nations with the United States and Russia playing the biggest roles will consist of more than elements that will take assembly flights to complete
It is due to be completed by 
The station will weigh tons more than a million pounds and is expected to cost at least dlrs billion with the United States planning to pay dlrs billion
It will serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for up to years
Zarya is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavor which is to be launched Dec
carrying the Unity connecting module
The shuttle crew will attach the two modules together in three space walks using the Endeavors robot arm
The meter feet Zarya holds more than tons of fuel in its tanks and is capable of flying independently for days
Its control system consists of thrusters and two large engines for major orbital changes
It will be launched by a three stage heavy lift Proton booster rocket that would put Zarya into orbit in less than minutes after the blastoff
In the ensuing days the ground controllers will gradually adjust its orbit in preparation for the meeting with Endeavor
The space station will not be inhabitable until early following the launch of a Russian crew module which is set to blast off next July or August
Russia has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines for constructing the crew module putting the whole project behind schedule
Having lost hope of getting the promised government funds the Russian space agency has sold its early research time on the station to NASA for dlrs million to complete the segment
Agency chief Yuri Koptev said that taking part in the new station is the only hope for the beleaguered Russian space industry whose funding has collapsed since the Soviet collapse
The project would allow Russia to keep up to jobs over the next years
Koptev assailed some Russian space engineers who continue to insist that more money should be put into Russia s own battered year old Mir space station to extend its lifetime instead of committing more funds to the new space outpost
The choice mustn t be determined by emotions
Some people are glued to one thing Mir and don t care about the rest Koptev said at a recent news conference
We must proceed from the understanding of what would take us into the future allow us to preserve our industry The Russian Khrunichev company has earned over dlrs million for building Zarya whose design was based on earlier Soviet spacecraft including some of the Mir s six modules
Russian space officials gave the first module of the international space station a routine tweak Saturday to push it into higher orbit and convened a meeting on Earth to map out its future
Flight controllers fired one of the module s two maneuvering engines to raise it to an orbit about kilometers miles in space the station s public affairs office said
Russian Space Agency general director Yuri Koptev told reporters the maneuver was carried out with great accuracy and the ton core module was cruising through space without any problems
The module called Zarya or Sunrise lifted off Friday from the Baikonur launchpad in Kazakstan into an initial orbit kilometers miles above Earth
Zarya is to serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the international project providing propulsion power and communications
It will fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavour which is to be launched Dec
carrying the Unity connecting module
The international space station is a US led successor to Russia s Mir space station and is being heralded by space officials as the vehicle for unprecedented international cooperation in space in the st century
The heads of the space agencies of the United States Russia Japan and Canada along with the European Space Agency met in Moscow on Saturday to discuss the project the Interfax news agency reported
The space agency heads agreed on a schedule for future meetings and on holding a scientific conference on the project somewhere in Europe at an unspecified date
Also Saturday the head of Russia s Mission Control Vladimir Lobachev was quoted as saying that Russia would take the lead role in managing the international space station during its first five years
Previously space officials have said the station would be jointly controlled from Moscow and Houston with the US space agency NASA taking a lead role
According to Interfax Lobachev said it made sense for Russia to control the project because the Russian built Zarya and a Russian built service module would perform most of the life support and navigational functions for the station s first five years
Furthermore Russian engineers are more experienced in this job and NASA officials are aware of this he said
The space station is expected to cost at least dlrs billion of which the United States is expected to pay dlrs billion
Russia s financing problems delayed the initial launch by a year and some critics have said the station amounts to an expensive way for NASA to keep Russia s beleaguered space program alive
The station will serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for at least years
Endeavour s astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station on Sunday creating a seven story tower in the shuttle cargo bay
It was the first time that the Russian built Zarya control module and the made in America Unity chamber had ever touched

NASA estimates more launches and more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex
Once completed the nation space station will have a mass of million pounds be longer than a football field and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts
The first piece of the international space station was orbiting Earth Friday sprouting antennae and unfolding solar power panels as it awaited other segments which will eventually grow into the largest orbital laboratory in history
The module called Zarya from the Russian term meaning sunrise or dawn took a flawless ride into space atop a three stage Russian Proton booster rocket that lifted off at am Eastern time from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan
The launching was witnessed by the heads of the space agencies of the nations that are sponsoring the station which will cost at least billion to build over the next five years
Zarya built in Russia with million from the United States is to be joined in two weeks by the first American module a docking hub called Unity
The space shuttle Endeavour is to take off on Dec
to rendezvous with Zarya and attach the two units
This is to be followed by more flights by American and Russian rockets carrying more than parts to be assembled in space to form a pound research station housing up to seven astronauts
Daniel Goldin the administrator of NASA said at a news conference following the launching Now we only have launches to go about hours of space walks and countless problems But because of all the partner nations trusting each other and working together he said the international space station is going to be a reality Even as the new space station is coming together questions continue about the fate of Russia s existing space laboratory the year old Mir
Because of the collapse of the Russian economy doubts that Russia can produce enough rockets and other equipment to support both projects led Russia to promise that it would abandon Mir and destroy the station by next summer
However in recent weeks Russian officials have been lobbying to find ways to extend Mir s life
According to a report by the news agency Reuters President Boris Yeltsin s space adviser Yevgeny Shaposhnikov said Friday he was preparing a number of proposals on extending Mir s life past the year 
Support for such options has been growing in recent weeks among Russian space officials astronauts and nationalists who see Mir as a symbol of Russian achievements in space
James Van Laak NASA s deputy manager of operations for the space station said Friday that the agency had not received any formal proposals about extending Mir s life
NASA would find such a proposal unacceptable if it has any measurable impact on the international space station Van Laak said in a telephone interview from the Johnson Space Center in Houston No one has any objection to Mir or keeping it operational if the Russians find a way to support both projects but they have to demonstrate they can Yuri Koptev head of the Russian Space Agency said the launching of Zarya a pound space tugboat that will supply power and propulsion in the early stages of station construction was a needed vindication for the troubled Russian space program
The Russian space industry is alive and well and is perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station Koptev said
Two astronauts ventured back out on another spacewalk Wednesday to attach antennas to the international space station under construction nearly miles above Earth
For the second time this week Jerry Ross and James Newman floated out the hatch of the shuttle Endeavour to work on the seven story ton station taking shape in the open cargo bay
Their No
priority was to attach two pound antennas to Unity the American made side of the space station
Their other job time permitting was trickier trying to open a stuck antenna on Zarya the Russian built control module
The planned seven hour spacewalk was not nearly as difficult or crucial as Monday night s outing during which Ross and Newman hooked up electrical connections between Zarya and Unity
The plan called for the men to lug two suitcase size antennas about halfway up Unity and install them on opposite sides of the foot cylinder
Once activated the antennas will provide a direct virtually uninterrupted communication link between Unity and NASA s Mission Control
Otherwise US flight controllers would have to rely on the sporadic coverage provided by Russian ground stations
The electronic and computer hookups for the antennas will be made inside Unity on Thursday after the entire crew enters the orbiting station for the first time
Other spacewalking chores for Ross and Newman on Wednesday evening included erecting a sunshade over a computer mounted to the outside of Unity
Mission Control decided just before the spacewalk to let Newman take a crack at unjamming the Zarya antenna
Flight controllers urged caution
The antenna was rolled up on a spool and engineers worried the foot strip might pop open with enough force to hurt him if he got too close
Newman had a foot grappling hook for the job
The antenna is one of two that failed to open properly following Zarya s Nov
launch from Kazakstan
One more spacewalk is planned for Endeavour s day mission On Saturday Ross and Newman will conduct a photo survey and take out a sack of tools that will be used by future station visitors
Newman also may try to unjam the other Zarya antenna
This was the sixth spacewalk for Ross during his year NASA career the most by an American and the third for Newman
