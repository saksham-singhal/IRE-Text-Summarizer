Greek media and officials leveled strong opposition Sunday to the possible extradition of Abdullah Ocalan the arrested Kurdish guerrilla leader to Greece s traditional rival Turkey
Ocalan whose Kurdistan Workers Party has waged a year war with Turkey for autonomy in southeastern Turkey is in prison custody in Rome where his arrest was announced Friday
We do not give advise to other countries said parliament speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis
Europe has a tradition of civilization and human rights and I think as a rule it abides by that tradition Greece has not officially responded to Ocalan s arrest which was welcomed by the United States
But Greek government officials have stressed support for Kurdish self determination
We have repeatedly brought attention to the problems created by the blatant violation of human rights in southeast Turkey government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said late Saturday
In the past Greece has accused Ankara of waging a campaign of genocide against its Kurdish population
Ankara counters that Greece is harboring PKK terrorists Both sides angrily deny the charges
Thousands of Kurdish refugees from northern Iraq and Turkey have sought refuge in Greece
A group of more than Kurds began a three day fast in a downtown Athens square Saturday in support of Ocalan
Within hours of the PKK leader s arrest Turkey requested his extradition to face a number of terrorism related charges which could carry the death penalty
Italy knows what the fate of the Kurdish rebel will be if he falls into the hands of the Turkish military regime said an editorial Saturday in the Greek daily Eleftherotypia
Ocalan has requested political asylum in Italy as head of the Kurdish liberation movement and should be allowed to remain in a democratic country
He must not be extradited to Turkey Greece s Communist party and a small leftist opposition party called on the government to exercise its influence on Italy to keep Ocalan there
The move was also supported by a number of parliamentary deputies from the governing Socialist party
Earlier this month a bloc of lawmakers in the member parliament issued an invitation for Ocalan to visit Greece
Facing his first real foreign policy test Prime Minister Massimo D Alema must decide what to do with a prominent Kurdish rebel leader who was arrested at the Rome airport on Thursday
Turkey wants Italy to extradite the rebel Abdullah Ocalan leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party which is seeking Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey
He is viewed in Turkey as a terrorist
Germany also has a warrant out for his arrest on homicide charges
But D Alema a former Communist who was appointed prime minister last month is under pressure from leftists in his coalition to offer Ocalan political asylum
In a news conference Monday D Alema recognized the extent of the problem
The last thing we wanted was an awkward and complicated situation like this one he said
He noted that Italian law prohibits extradition of suspects to countries that have the death penalty
Turkey has capital punishment though it says it will soon abolish it
Ocalan is being tried in absentia there on charges that could bring the death penalty
D Alema said a committee in the Interior Ministry would determine whether Ocalan would qualify for political asylum which would be possible if Ocalan s promise to renounce terrorism issued Monday holds up
We do not want someone who organizes terrorism in Italy D Alema said
This is an opportunity to find an exit from a bloody conflict Earlier Monday while members of D Alema s government met with Turkish officials who were in Rome for a European ministerial meeting thousands of Kurds flooded into Rome to hold a demonstration and hunger strike in support of Ocalan
D Alema s decision was further complicated on Sunday when Turkish inmates in a prison in Istanbul took an Italian prisoner hostage saying they would release him only after Italy extradited Ocalan
Monday D Alema said he would not bow to pressure

He is wanted for questioning in Switzerland in connection with a killing
Turkey s Anatolia news agency said Oz was determined not to free his hostage until Italy agreed to Turkey s demand to send back Ocalan who is Turkey s most wanted man
He is not in any life threatening danger
We are not alarmed for his safety said prosecutor Celil Demircioglu
The negotiations are continuing we believe he will be freed very soon Demircioglu said Calascibetta s extradition would now be delayed by a few days

INNSBRUCK Austria AP Italian authorities have turned back at least people along the Austro Italian border during an immigration crackdown prompted by the arrest of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan Austrian officials said Monday
Most of those sent back since the crackdown began Saturday were refused entry into Italy because they had no visas or residence permits the Austrians said
On Monday alone about people were refused entry at the Brenner Pass crossing point
They included Pakistanis Indians Yugoslavs and Chinese as well as Kurds the Austrians said
The border crackdown appeared designed to prevent large numbers of Kurds living in Western Europe from flocking to Rome for protests in connection with Ocalan s arrest
Turkey has asked for Ocalan s extradition
Austrian authorities said many of those turned back had come from Germany
A Red Cross station was set up at the border to assist those turned away to return to Germany if their residence permits were in order
Those without proper papers were detained by Austrian immigration
About policemen were assigned to protect Turkish President Suleyman Demirel who arrived Tuesday on a three day official visit
President Thomas Klestil s invitation for the visit was issued to take place during Austria s European Union presidency
Austrian government officials reportedly will try to open up a longer term perspective for Turkey s EU membership
A related topic certain to come up is Cyprus among six countries with whom the European Union started formal membership talks on Nov
In a rare joint statement the Netherlands Germany and France said the inability of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to reconcile their differences weighed heavily on their island s membership chances
They spoke of fundamental problems in the Cyprus negotiating process adding a political solution is urgently required Austrian police took special measures to ensure the safety of the Turkish visitor
The political situation requires comprehensive security measures the Austria Press Agency quoted Walter Zehetmayr a senior police officer as saying
The extra effort was prompted by the arrest last week in Rome of Abdullah Ocalan the chief of the Turkish Workers Party PKK Zehetmayr said
He hinted that he expects large protests of Turkish groups in Vienna

A Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in Turkey s southeast faces an uncertain future following the detention in Rome of its founder and leader
Italian authorities captured Abdullah Ocalan at Rome s international airport Thursday
Turkey has asked for his extradition and Ocalan has asked for political asylum
Some believe that without Ocalan who ruled some loyal rebels with an iron fist his Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK will be left in disarray
If the head is dethroned the rebellion gets a mortal blow said Cengiz Candar who has been following the Kurdish insurgency for daily Sabah
But Ocalan has been absent from the battlefield for at least a month and others contend that the PKK is capable of operating without him
Let us not fall into false expectations that this will be the end of the PKK
The PKK has already been acting like a headless monster for too long said Ilnur Cevik of the English language Turkish Daily News
Turkish newspapers have carried frequent reports of power struggles within the PKK and said that Ocalan s grip on the PKK was beginning to waver
Better known as Apo Ocalan founded the Kurdistan Workers Party PKK in 
The movement turned to armed struggle in mainly focusing on guerrilla style warfare in the southeast but also carrying out bomb attacks on civilians in western Turkey
Close to people died in the conflict
His presence in Europe could also be a blessing in disguise for the group forcing the PKK to transform itself from a rebel army into a political movement
Ocalan seemed to be moving in this direction before his detention
While living in Damacus he increased his meetings with European deputies
This may be the PKK s best option
The Turkish military claims it has made important battlefield gains and captured the PKK s second in command this year
The rebels also seem to have lost the support of Syria which appears to have forced Ocalan to leave after Turkey threatened to attack it
Two Iraqi Kurdish groups controlling Turkey s border with Iraq have also grown lukewarm
The PKK has used their bases in Syria and Iraq to wage cross border operations
The PKK had two options
Either they choose to fight until they get control of the area regardless of what image they project abroad or they try to take on a political image
I believe Ocalan wanted to leave the Middle East so he could become a political figure said Hikmet Tavak managing director of the London based Kurdish television MED TV
In Rome spokesmen for the PKK said Ocalan had carefully selected Italy because he felt there was sympathy there for his cause
They also said Italian authorities were warned that Ocalan would be arriving
There is a fair amount of sympathy for the Kurds in Europe and if the movement gains political momentum Turkey could come under more pressure from its western allies to grant the Kurds minority rights
There are an estimated to million Kurds in Turkey
They are not recognized as an official minority and barred from using Kurdish in education or broadcasting
Kurdish politicians have been jailed and groups banned on charges of supporting the PKK
