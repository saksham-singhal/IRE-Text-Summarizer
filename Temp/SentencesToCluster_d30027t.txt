Wall Street extended a global stock selloff Thursday with the Dow industrials tumbling more than points for a second straight day
The Dow Jones industrial average which plunged points on Wednesday fell an additional or by percent to close at Broader market indicators also sank sharply in heavy trading
Bank and technology stocks were particularly hard hit
The selling spree amid worries about shrinking corporate profits and fears of new financial crises left the Dow percent or more than points below the all time high of reached on July 
It was getting closer to the low of that was reached during trading Sept
before Wall Street s best known indicator began a comeback bid that brought it above as recently as Monday
The Dow s percent slide in the third quarter which ended Wednesday was its worst quarterly performance in eight years
It now is percent below where it began this year
Stock prices earlier plunged in Asia with Tokyo shares falling percent to a new year low and shares were falling sharply in Europe where Germany s central bank left interest rates unchanged
Blue chips in London sank percent to close at new lows for the year while the key index in Frankfurt Germany closed down percent and the main indicator in Paris was off percent
The selloff in stocks has sent a flood of money into US Treasury securities a traditional haven in times of uncertainty
Yields on year Treasury bonds fell further below percent Thursday reaching levels unseen for long term government bonds since 
Traders were alarmed to see prices on the New York Stock Exchange nosedive percent on Wednesday even though the Federal Reserve had lowered a key interest rate one quarter percentage point on Tuesday
Some traders were disappointed that the cut was not deeper amid fears a go slow approach would not do enough to counter the economic crises that have swept through Asia and Russia and are threatening Latin America
The smaller than expected lowering of interest rates by the US Federal Reserve has a chain reaction said Lee Won ho an analyst at Samsung Securities Co
in Seoul South Korea where the main stock index fell by percent
It is affecting Wall Street the Japanese market ours and others The managing director of the International Monetary Fund Michel Camdessus on Thursday said the Fed made the right decision in cutting rates and that global powers now must push for stronger growth to offset steep recessions in Asia and Russia
Asked why stock markets particularly in the United States have reacted so negatively to the Fed rate cut Camdessus said he believed confidence will soon be restored especially if financial leaders show resolve in their discussions over the next week
There also are worries about where the next financial market crisis may erupt after last week s dlrs billion private bailout of Long Term Capital Management LP of Greenwich Connecticut
In addition investors worldwide worry that the downturn on Wall Street could signal a possible slowdown in economic growth a bad omen for the many foreign companies dependent on exports to the huge US market
There s a psychological impact overall but there s also a direct impact on companies like Sony and TDK which derive a high percentage of their earnings from overseas markets said Pelham Smithers a stock strategist in Tokyo at ING Baring Securities Japan Ltd
A new survey in Japan said confidence among small and medium sized businesses about the economy plunged to its worst level since the Bank of Japan began the quarterly samplings in 
The United States is disappointed by the economic confusion within the new Russian government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday and she warned Russia about the dangers of an anti Western policy
In her first comprehensive review of US Russian relations since Primakov was confirmed as prime minister last month Albright said Washington was deeply concerned about Russia s direction and did not think the crisis there would soon abate
We have heard a lot of talk in recent days about printing new money indexing wages imposing price and capital controls and restoring state management of parts of the economy she told the US Russia Business Council in Chicago
We can only wonder if some members of Primakov s team understand the basic arithmetic of the global economy While praising Primakov once her counterpart when he was foreign minister as a pragmatist able to cooperate on key issues with Washington she had harsh words of warning for him
Our initial reaction to some of the direction he s going in has not been particularly positive she said adding The question now is whether that cooperation can continue The United States must keep up its aid to Russia but is adjusting it to promote the building of democracy and student exchanges as well as arms control Albright said
Washington does not favor more direct aid
More big bailouts are not by themselves going to restore investor confidence in Russia she said
In the long run the gap between Russia s needs and its resources must be met not by foreign bailouts but by foreign investment Albright sharply criticized as self defeating the many voices in Russia who want to shift the emphasis in Russia s interaction with America and our allies from one of partnership to one of assertiveness opposition and defiance for its own stake Russia could not stand alone in the world she said and the United States ability to help Russians help themselves will go from being merely very very difficult to being absolutely impossible At the same time she said Washington would not assume the worst for there are still plenty of people in Russia who will fight against turning back the clock And she urged the world and American critics to be patient with the workings of the democratic process in Russia and not start each day by taking a census of reformers in the Kremlin a census that American officials themselves promoted before President Boris Yeltsin dismissed the previous government
While Moscow may continue to oppose any NATO use of force against Serbian forces in the southern province of Kosovo Albright said NATO must be prepared to act regardless
President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly to any effort to prohibit Russians from buying foreign currencies believing the move would be like bringing another Iron Curtain down on the country his spokesman said Friday
The president clearly understands that such a ban would be a clear violation of our rights that would mean a return to the Iron Curtain in everyday life said presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushin
The remarks came after media reports of a government economic plan in the works that would prohibit Russians from buying US dollars and other foreign currencies and institute other strict economic controls rolling back seven years of reforms
Though government officials say such a plan is only one of six possibilities Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Thursday that he might be forced to take unpopular measures to rescue the Russian economy if it does not receive the next installment in a dlrs billion loan from the International Monetary Fund
Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov flew to Washington on Friday for negotiations with the IMF over the dlrs billion installment
IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to come up with a sound economic program before the loan is given and have made it clear that currency controls and boosting the money supply by printing rubles are not acceptable
But Primakov said that the country s plan would be dependent on the IMF loan not the other way around
No short term economic plan will be known for another three weeks long after the IMF is set to make its decision said First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov
A draft version of the government s fourth quarter budget would rely heavily on the IMF loan the Kommersant newspaper said
Without the loan the government would have to engage in major deficit spending
Calls for Soviet style controls part of the plan drafted by First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov and leaked to the press have apparently created a rift within the Cabinet
The plan drew heavy criticism from Zadornov and Gerashchenko called the idea of banning foreign currency sales a mad idea Meanwhile Russia s stock market dropped by percent to Friday but trading was so light the downward move meant little
The stock market has continued to fall since the crisis hit Aug
And tax collection was down in September the result of the collapse in Russia s banking system said Alexander Pochinok head of the government s finance and credit department
Revenues totaled billion rubles dlrs million million rubles dlrs million less than expected
The government wants to reverse this trend by raising taxes for oil and gas companies but the idea is expected to meet sharp resistance in the lower house of Russia s parliament which wants to cut tax rates Pochinok said
If the Communist Party has its way and it has been planning for months millions of Russians will take to the streets on Wednesday for some of the biggest demonstrations in years
But now that Communists or politicians with the Communist stamp of approval are running the country and its economy the question is what the marchers will be demonstrating against
President Boris Yeltsin and his economic advisers were easy targets two months ago
But Yeltsin seems but a shadow of himself today and his advisers are gone
The Communists who have undergone a sort of resurgence by playing on the discontent are working hard to cast themselves as outsiders in the government that they help run and to keep the focus of the protests on Wednesday on Yeltsin and his policies
Even that strategy may backfire however because discontent over Yeltsin does not necessarily translate into support for his predecessors
An adviser to the Communist Party leader Gennadi Zyuganov made headlines not long ago when he called the new government bourgeois
The characterization was striking because the new prime minister Yevgeny Primakov was one of Zyuganov s top choices for the post
The deputy prime minister in charge of the economy Yuri Maslyukov is a Communist Party figure who once headed Gosplan the infamous central planning program that helped bring the Soviet Union to ruin
We don t have slogans that are aimed against the government the first secretary of the Moscow Communist Party committee Alexander Kuvayev said in a recent interview
All the slogans are aimed against the president and the economic course of the country
Only the president can fully be blamed for the course that has brought the country to this situation Anger over Russia s fate and their own is drawing some Russians back to Soviet style slogans and old style hostility toward capitalism
The ardently pro Communist newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya devoted most of its front page on Thursday to what it said were the results of a contest among readers for protest slogans
The entries ranged from catchy to kitschy from Legislator official banker study the Constitution the exam is Oct
to Imperialist Help Russia return the exported capital and we will pay the debts at once Russia has seen nothing approaching this sort of economic chaos and despair since when hyperinflation swept the economy
There is no real way of knowing whether the latest travails will produce huge and ugly crowds or small peaceful ones
A deputy editor and political analyst at a newsweekly Itogi Masha Lipman said the situation was not unlike that of when Yeltsin sought and won a popular mandate in a referendum
He used it to dissolve the Communist dominated Parliament and increase his own power
That led to an autumn showdown the shelling of Parliament by tanks and the total defeat for the time being of Yeltsin s legislative opponents
You can interpret this demonstration as a Communist mandate but I don t think they will act like Yeltsin Ms Lipman said
Support for the Communists is at its smallest level maybe percent In a survey of people that was released last week the All Russian Public Opinion Center said that nearly half the population supported the idea of demonstrations against Yeltsin but that barely one tenth were likely to participate in any way
Nobody is interested in any sort of struggle Yuri Levada who heads the center said in an interview
This is mainly a general expression of a great wave of distrust of authorities mainly the president
He s the great scapegoat for all our sins There seems to be little enthusiasm for demonstrations of any sort
Only a few thousand people turned out Sunday for the fifth anniversary of the shelling of Parliament and Yeltsin s subsequent triumph over the Communists
The Communist Party and the Federation of Independent Russian Unions a leftist organization that says it is the main sponsor of the protests predict that million Russians will participate on Wednesday
The government has vowed to keep order without resorting to force
But it is concerned enough that it has summoned police officers to patrol Moscow and military troops to intervene if violence erupts
Protests since have generally been tepid a deep seated feeling here
Some demonstrations last week more or less practice runs hinted at similarly dampened marches this year
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday that the economic crisis would not bring an end to the government s program of privatizing state property
Privatization will be accomplished for growth of production growth of investment and growth of production effectiveness through renewal of major funds Primakov said during a meeting of Western businessmen
We shall conduct privatization so that it serves the interests of the people the state and business he said according to the ITAR Tass news agency
Primakov reassured the businessmen members of the prime minister s consultive council on foreign investment in Russia that the government had no plans to ban the circulation of US dollars in Russia
But he said the government would take steps to staunch the flow of dollars from Russia
Responding to media reports of a government economic plan that would prohibit Russians from buying US dollars and other foreign currency Primakov said the reports absolutely do not correspond to reality ITAR Tass quoted him as saying
He said there was no need to regulate the influx of dollars into Russia but the government should take steps to prevent what he called the dollar drain Russian companies stashed about dlrs billion outside the country in September alone the Interfax news agency reported Friday quoting central bank figures
Primakov said foreign investors are the force that will help Russia to minimize its losses from the current economic crisis
We are very much interested in foreign investments especially in ones that go into the real production sector Primakov said according to Interfax
We need a continuous dialogue with foreign investors without whom it will be difficult for us to overcome the current difficulties He said Russia wanted long term investments
Foreign capital has been coming to the country via short term operations Primakov said
This he said is not to our liking or yours Viktor Gerashchenko the central bank chairman said on Friday that the government must act to stem the flow of dollars from Russia
Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov were in Washington Saturday for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund where they plan to spell out the measures Russia is taking to bail out its finance system
Russia wants the IMF to release the second dlrs billion installment of a loan that was approved in July a month before the country s economy crashed and the government effectively defaulted on its foreign loans
IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to come up with a sound economic program before the installment is given and have made it clear that currency controls and boosting the money supply by printing rubles are not acceptable
Ukraine s parliament on Friday refused to approve President Leonid Kuchma s decree establishing a state fund to compensate people for savings lost in banks
Deputies voted to prepare a revised version of the decree and debate it later in the month
They must consider the decree by Oct
or else it automatically takes effect under the constitution
Leftist factions which voted against the proposed legislation said it would not fully guarantee the return of savings lost during the financial instability that has recently hit Ukraine
The fund Kuchma proposed to establish would have accumulated money in a special National Bank account and repay people in case the bank they kept their savings in went bankrupt or became insolvent
Although the decree provided for compensation of deposits amounting only to hryvna dlrs at the current exchange rate its authors said it would cover more than percent of Ukrainians who keep their money in banks
The measure was meant to prevent mass withdrawals of deposits that most Ukrainian banks have already experienced as people scared by the fall of the national currency and the turmoil in neighboring Russia started to stock up on food clothing and household goods
Government officials say that Ukrainians have recently withdrawn at least percent of the billion hryvna dlrs million they deposited in banks
Russia s new prime minister picked an unusual way to reassure the nation Thursday
After two weeks of deliberations he announced that he still had no plan to rescue the country from its economic crisis
I want to repeat once more there is no program Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
It has yet to be worked out In most nations such a statement might provoke alarm
But Primakov was seeking to calm an anxious public that was worried that the Kremlin s cure could be worse than the disease
It is not as if Russians do not have something to be concerned about
Thursday Primakov convened a meeting of top aides to try to hammer out a strategy for overcoming the economic woes
A main item on the agenda was the plan drafted by Yuri Maslyukov a Communist and the government s senior policy maker on economic issues
It did not take long for Maslyukov s plan to hit the street
A newspaper Kommersant Daily published it in full Thursday morning
Not surprisingly Maslyukov s plan calls for a greater state role in the economy including controls on hard currency
A new State Bank for Reconstruction and Development would be established using the nationalized assets of failed commercial banks
Wages and pensions would be paid in two months and the minimum wage would be indexed to inflation
There would be huge tax cuts a combination that suggested that the government was committed to printing additional money
The exchange rate of the ruble would be set by the central bank based on changes in inflation and the balance of payments
Maslyukov s plan also implies that Russians would be able to buy dollars at exchanges through the country
It stipulates that hard currency could enter the country only with special authorization
Exporters would be required to sell most of their hard currency reserves
That is an allusion to currency controls that sent shock waves through the Russian public
Russians have come to treat the dollar as a second currency and many people have squirreled away dollars as a hedge against inflation
It is an obvious stupidity Otto Latsis a commentator with the newspaper Noviye Izvestiya said
People won t give their dollars away
They will go to the black market if they need to Yegor Gaidar the former prime minister who favors free markets said the plan was a war against the dollar and predicted that it would lead to a shortage of imports
As the criticism grew Primakov rushed to distance himself from the talk of currency controls
The rumors of the state s becoming a monopolist on the inflow of hard currency into the country is nonsense he said asserting that the document published by Kommersant Daily was just one of six possible plans
Primakov may be opposed to wildly unpopular currency controls
He may be worried that the plan would would set off the panic buying of dollars further depressing the ruble
Or he may simply be trying to keep his distance from Maslyukov s plan while Russia tries to wrangle its next disbursement billion from the International Monetary Fund
The particulars could be modified but many people following the maneuvering say they believe that it represents the basic thrust of the government s thinking
Primakov has called for greater state regulation and an expansion of the money supply two themes of Maslyukov s plan
The plan also has many similarities with the plan presented to the government by Gorbachev era advisers
We think it is close to being a final document said the United Financial Group a Russian investment business
It is unclear how long Primakov can carry on without spelling out a detailed strategy
The ousted tax chief Boris Fyodorov has argued that the IMF should not provide further aid until Primakov has taken tough measures to build a free market
Primakov has however sought to turn that logic on its head arguing that his government s economic strategy will depend on the fund s willingness to provide aid
His aim appears to be to pressure the fund by implying that it will be the fund s fault if Russia is forced to default on its loans or take draconian measures at home
Or as Primakov put it Thursday without the fund s money Russia will have to impose unpopular measures 
In a season of crashing banks plunging rubles bouncing paychecks failing cropsand rotating governments maybe it is not the ultimate insult
But the nation that bore Tolstoy and Chekhov and still regards a well written letter as a labor of love is buckling a little this week because it can no longer wish good health to Baba Anya in Omsk
The Post Office is broke
In of the country s statelike regions more than mail cars have been sidetracked many stuffed with up to tons of letters newspapers and parcels
The state Railway Ministry refuses to carry more mail until the Post Office makes good on some million rubles in old bills about million in today s dollars or million in dollars six weeks ago
Air mail which amounts to one of every four or five letters was also suspended at one of Moscow s major airports until this week when the Post Office coughed up million rubles for old bills
A second airport is still demanding million rubles for past due debts
So much mail is backed up that post offices in Moscow and elsewhere have simply stopped accepting out of town mail except for areas that can be easily reached by truck
Delivery schedules have fallen weeks and perhaps months behind
The situation is really extraordinary said Vladimir Sherekhov the deputy chief of mail service administration in the government s Communications Committee
We ve never had anything like this before Maybe the Post Office has been lucky
Extraordinary is the rule elsewhere in Russia
Until Friday the lower house of Parliament was preparing to sue the government for failure to provide soap heat toilet paper and copy machine paper in the legislature s monumental downtown offices
It turned out that politicians had exhausted their funds by cutting short their recess and returning to address the nation s economic crisis
Earlier in the week officials said Russia s Arctic shipping routes may close next month because half the nation s icebreakers are in disrepair and there is no money to fix them
The oldest of the ships is so ancient that its nickname is Granny
Such anecdotal evidence that Russia is losing its wheels like one of its old ill maintained Volga sedans is everywhere
But oddly real signs of public distress are not particularly common perhaps because the system rarely seems to shed a part as big as a postal system
If the US Postal Service is increasingly a pipeline for sweepstakes notices and bills the Russian Post Office still holds a special place in the national conversation
Russians still write letters to each other frequently and fervently and many in remote regions get their news through the mail
Millions use the mails to ship canned goods and other provisions to needy relatives and friends in faraway areas an especially vital service in winter
And in the last few years the Post Office has become a vehicle for a growing mail order trade in books clothes and other catalog items not readily available outside big cities
Exactly why all this has rumbled to a halt is in some dispute
What is clear is that the Post Office and the Railway Ministry both suffer from what ails every Russian venture private and public alike Nobody pays his bills
The state Railway Ministry complains that it is continually stiffed by customers who believe the railroads are honor bound to carry freight whether they are paid or not
The government has specified nearly categories of freight which the railroads must carry for next to nothing
Among the biggest deadbeats are the power ministries the military and interior departments which did not pay during Soviet times and feel little need to pay now
It s a psychology formed during the socialist period said Tatiana Pashkova the deputy spokeswoman for the ministry and the same situation exists with the Post Office
We ve been in dispute for a very long time
Always we try to understand their differences
But we can t carry cargo for free No kidding says the Post Office It too is owed million rubles by government agencies and is barred from raising rates even though freight costs are outstripping revenues
Moreover the Post Office is also required by the government to carry some forms of mail such as pension checks at reduced rates
Officials at the state Communications Department say they also suspect an ulterior motive in the railroads actions a struggle to dominate the thriving mail order business
Here s competition between us and the railroads for the delivery of parcels and I think decisions made by the railroads are mainly explained by this competition Sherekhov said
They blame us for carrying some commercial cargoes instead of mail The Railways Ministry s spokeswoman Ms Pashkova said such commercial cargoes are indeed a problem but only because the railroads know that the Post Office has already gotten cash to transport the packages
The railroads are still waiting for their share of that money she said
In the meantime the situation has come to a boil
In late September the railroads cut mail service in and out of Moscow effectively decapitating the postal system and forcing officials to draft a fleet of trucks to move letters in and out of the city
Hundreds of empty and full rail cars have clogged some local yards to the point where moving cars into position for unloading has become difficult
At last count loaded cars were awaiting service at one yard
And customers are getting angry
We ve gotten all kinds of complaints said Viktor Salikov a deputy in the Communications Department s mail shipping center
People are even coming to us searching for mail that was sent weeks ago 
President Leonid Kuchma called Friday for corrections to Ukraine s program of market reforms but pledged that reforms would continue
Kuchma did not elaborate in his comments to a group of Ukrainian economists saying only that the changes were necessary because of the country s economic problems
Kuchma urged the economists to come up with recommendations before a national meeting of economists in November the Interfax news agency reported
Ukraine has suffered economic problems since the collapse of the Soviet Union and it has been especially hard hit by the financial crisis in neighboring Russia its main trading partner
The Russian crisis has hurt bilateral trade caused the Ukrainian currency to fall and led to a withdrawal of investors from Ukraine
In recent months Kuchma has implemented some economic reforms by decree prompting the International Monetary Fund to release the first installment of a long awaited dlrs billion loan
Many reforms however remain stalled
National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko was in Washington this week for consultations with IMF officials
Yushchenko has warned that the bank would not spend its dwindling reserves to support the hryvna currency but has avoided comments on the currency in recent days
Kuchma met Friday with Yushchenko Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and other senior officials to discuss ways to stabilize the hryvna
The government s press service said they focused on possible ways to keep the hryvna under to the US dollar through the end of the year
The hryvna has been trading at to the dollar in recent days but trading has been limited
There are wide expectations in Ukraine that the hryvna will fall even further and Ukrainians have been stocking up on food clothing and household goods to save their fast devaluing money
