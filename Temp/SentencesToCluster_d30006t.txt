In a decision that will almost certainly lead to the first work stoppage in National Basketball Association history the league Monday announced the cancellation of all preseason games
Citing stalled negotiations with the Players Association over a new collective bargaining agreement league officials said they would decide next week whether to cancel the first week of regular season games
While the decision had been expected for days it nonetheless sent a strong signal that the owners and players will probably be willing to cancel at least part of the regular season in order to settle their labor dispute
Both sides agree that it would take at least three weeks to hold abbreviated training camps and sign over free agents to new contracts
Privately officials on both sides do not believe the season will start as scheduled on Nov
or even before December
Unlike Major League Baseball the National Football League and the National Hockey League the NBA has never lost a regular season game to labor strife
Since we re not even negotiating you have to conclude it s very likely that we re going miss some part of the regular season deputy commissioner Russ Granik said Monday night
We ll try and defer any decisions until the last minute but right now it does not look good The two sides will meet on Thursday their first official bargaining session since Aug
Commissioner David Stern and a group of owners walked out of a meeting after dismissing the merits of a new proposal from the players
Neither Granik nor players association executive director Billy Hunter sounded as if this week s meeting would go a long way toward the signing of a new agreement the precursor to playing again
I don t think you have any choice but to miss games at this point Hunter said
In fact I think the they ve intended it all along
They ve locked us out they ve refused to negotiate and they ve given us a proposal that s ludicrous Not only are both sides still awaiting the outcome of an arbitration decision that is due before Oct
the Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more than players with million in guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout but the owners and players also are making time to win public opinion before they test their fans loyalties by canceling games
Monday in cities throughout the country the players are holding make shift press conferences at training camp venues NBA arenas and gymnasiums
Patrick Ewing the union president and several teammates will speak at SUNY Purchase in Purchase NY where the Knicks train during the season
With training camp originally scheduled to open on Oct
the message from the players is clear if the owners would call an end to the lockout we would be ready to play today
About players are expected to attend speak and sign autographs for fans afterward
I wish they would put their energies into trying to negotiate a deal rather than the various other things that they ve been doing Granik said
The dispute is essentially over how the owners and players will judiciously divvy up billion in income
It began last year with the contention by the owners that their employees were receiving more than their fair share of the pot
The owners were allowed to terminate the current agreement because of a clause that enabled them to do so after player salaries reached percent of total basketball related income
The owners say that figure is currently hovering around percent
Though many economic issues need to be resolved the main point of contention since the labor agreement expired and the owners declared a lockout on July has been a clause which allows teams to pay their own free agents whatever they want regardless of salary cap rules governing the NBA s teams
Called the Larry Bird exception it was created to allow the Hall of Fame Boston Celtics forward to re sign with the Celtics near the end of his career
Michael Jordan exercised the clause the last two years with the Chicago Bulls earning more than million per season figures more than million more what a team is allowed to spend on all its players
But with exorbitant salaries paid to several unproven stars over the last few years and million deals sprouting up routinely the owners are determined to swing the income pendulum back toward themselves by enforcing a restricted salary cap a hard cap and putting a ceiling on how much one player could earn
Last year the players received about billion dollars in salaries and benefits and we have made proposals that are guaranteed to increase that number by percent over the next four years Granik said in a prepared statement
Our proposals would result in an average player salary of more than million and a minimum salary for year veterans of 
Unfortunately the union leadership has been unwilling to give any serious consideration to what we have offered Hunter labeled those claims as optimistic projections and shot down a number of new proposals presented to the players on Sept
If they had left the current deal in place we would have gotten much of that anyway he added
All we re saying is we re not in position to accept a hard cap Monday s decision to cancel the preseason came less than two weeks after the NBA indefinitely postponed training camp and canceled the first week of exhibition games
Through tickets sales alone Granik estimated that losing the exhibition season would cost the league between million and million
Decisions about the cancellations of regular season games are expected to be made next week he added
A league official said the games would be canceled in blocks of one or two weeks depending upon circumstances regarding negotiations
Thursday s bargaining session has suddenly become the last hope at starting the season on time
Hurdles could be overcome very quickly but I have no reason to believe they will on Thursday Granik said
Added Hunter Of course they don t expect much to get done
When Russ and David decide the negotiations are going to be real and substantive then something will happen
What they re banking on now is that the players are going to miss paychecks and cave in November
It s as if they ve ingested something that has to pass
And once it passes then they ll negotiate 
The National Basketball Association embroiled in a labor dispute with its players Tuesday canceled the first two weeks of the season
It is the first time in the league s year history that it will lose regular season games
The NBA s deputy commissioner Russ Granik announced the cancellation after nearly three and a half hours of meetings concluded at a Manhattan hotel
The decision to cancel games between Nov
and Nov
came after the players association proposed the implementation of a tax system instead of a hard salary cap a proposal the owners said they would respond to by Friday
We tried our best today to try to do what was possible to salvage the season said Alonzo Mourning the Miami Heat center
Unfortunately it didn t work out After games without a blemish the NBA now joins the National Hockey League the National Football League and Major League Baseball in having lost games to a labor dispute
Taking into account that a three to four week period would be needed for training camp and free agent signings before the season starts the league said it would decide in two weeks whether to make further cancellations
I m very sad and disappointed said the NBA commissioner David Stern
I consider it to be a collective failure but I honestly don t know what else we could have done
I do things that I like to think are in the best interests of the game
And I believe this is The decision came after what both sides agreed were the most substantive talks since the owners imposed a lockout on the player July 
Seventeen players including union president Patrick Ewing and vice presidents Mitch Richmond Herb Williams Dikemebe Mutombo and Ty Corbin attended the meeting along with Stern Granik and five members of the ownership committee Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts and owners Abe Pollin of Washington Gordon Gund of Cleveland Les Alexander of Houston and Jerry Colangelo of Phoenix
The talks featured what the players association implied were a bevy concessions made to the owners that they felt would accommodate the league s desire to swing the revenue pendulum back toward the owners
The dispute involves the distribution of approximately billion in league wide income
The main sticking point has been the owners insistence on a salary cap without exceptions the implementation of which they believe would bring player salaries in line with revenue growth
While the players did not discuss the elimination of the Larry Bird exception a clause that allows a player to secure any amount of money he wants in re signing with his current team they did address the exception in their taxation proposal
The main points were as follows A percent tax would be imposed on salary earned above million a clause that would affect only a few players who exercised their Bird rights
For example if a player made million the team would be forced to put million into a fund that would most likely be distributed to low revenue teams
There could be provisions made for some players said Jeffrey Kessler the chief outside counsel for the union
We don t want to do anything that would encourage Chicago from getting Michael Jordan back
And I think the league feels the same way The proposal is similar to the luxury tax proposed by the union in during negotiations but it would not be nearly as liberal
A salary cap credit would go into effect if the league pays out more than percent of revenues in salary
Whatever figure over that number reduces the salary cap the next year
If the figure was million over the salary cap then the teams would work with a salary cap million less than the previous season
But the players would have an assurance that the salary cap would go up at least million before the credit goes into effect
Also if the percent threshold is met a reduction of annual percent raises would take effect for multi year contracts
Players would either get raises of percent or the rate of growth in league revenues
The union said this clearly addresses the league s desire to bring salaries in line with revenues
Since the owners re opened the current agreement because percent of revenue was going toward salaries the percent figure would probably have to come down substantially for the owners to agree to such a proposal
Teams would get a right of first refusal on free agents after the fourth year for incoming rookies meaning a player would be contractually obligated to the same team for the first four years of his deal
Currently the rookie scale is three years and includes a clause that enables a player to exercise his Bird rights after two seasons a clause Kevin Garnett parlayed into an astronomical million deal last year with Minnesota
Finally the players agreed to make marijuana a banned substance
Details of testing have not been negotiated and no specific discussions took place regarding testing for performance enhancing drugs a provision the owners included in their last proposal
In return for the concessions the players want an increase in the minimum salary currently and creation of an average salary exception
This would allow every team above the salary cap being able to sign one free agent per year for the average salary currently million
We re buoyed by the fact for the first time they ve decided to submit a counterproposal the union s executive director Billy Hunter said
I don t know if I m more optimistic but I can earnestly say we can look our ballplayers in the eye and say we made a valiant effort Asked if the players would finally be tested financially with the cancellation of games Hunter added It s not about us blinking
We want to reach an agreement
We re tired of the rhetoric we re tired of the game playing
Our position all along has been we don t want to accept a bad deal Granik said refunds to fans would be made at end of the calendar month and that the first refund would include monies for canceled preseason games
He estimated the losses into the hundreds of millions of dollars I think we have serious concern whether a tax system can address the kind of needs we have economically he added
But there s some possibility Added Stern We owe it to the fans to go back and look at the notion whether a tax rate might begin to achieve the result we wanted
It doesn t look promising but we re going to spend the next two days to see if we can give a favorable response Though the decision to cancel games was not surprising it did represent a major shift in prior labor stalemates
Both sides reluctantly hammered out a deal in before the start of training camp with the sole notion of not missing games and preserving the NBA s perfect record
Tuesday they could not come to such an accord
I d like to think these our the last games we have to cancel Granik said
But unless this or something else works or there s some dramatic breakthrough I think that is certainly not all of the season that s in jeopardy 
More than National Basketball Association players with guaranteed contracts will find out Monday whether they are to be paid during the management lockout a long awaited arbitrator s decision that may affect leverage in the league s dispute with the players and have major ramifications on American sports labor law
But neither the players nor the owners are counting on the ruling by the arbitrator John Feerick to speed up negotiations especially if Feerick finds in favor of the players an award that could approach million in salaries
NBA attorneys have indicated to the union that if the decision goes against management they will seek to have it vacated by appealing to the US District Court in Manhattan and then if necessary to the nd US Circuit Court of Appeals a process that could prevent the players from getting paid for several months
The NBA has already canceled the first two weeks of the regular season because of the labor dispute
The league has other litigation pending in US District Court in Manhattan
If the players win the ruling the NBA intends to renew its motion to disqualify Feerick
The motion was brought last summer on the grounds that no collective bargaining agreement existed and therefore he had no jurisdiction to hear the matter
If he rules in our favor I think it emboldens the spirit and the resolve of the players said Billy Hunter union executive director
But we understand that won t end the lockout
It just means they have to pay some players
And there is still other litigation alive that may take a while to resolve
At most it s a hollow victory Feerick will have taken the full days to render his decision
Whatever he decides his ruling will be watched carefully
There is no precedent for locked out athletes being paid
During the NBA summer lockout of players who missed paychecks did not file a grievance
Neither did National Hockey League players who were locked out for the first three months of the season
The union argued that owners should have protected themselves by inserting clauses about non payment for lockouts and strikes into individual player contracts
In support of its arguments the union pointed to clauses in a few individual player contracts that contained language precluding payment during a lockout
The league is relying on the basic tenets of labor law which hold that employees not be paid during strikes or lockouts
A ruling for the union would be significant for all future negotiations between players and owners
The deterrent factor of a lockout is that employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement do not get paid once the agreement expires and they are unable to reach a new agreement
If Feerick finds in favor of the players there will be no economic incentive for those with guaranteed contracts to reach an agreement quickly
They would essentially be paid for not playing basketball
If Feerick finds in favor of the owners the reality of not being paid may spur the players to reach an agreement more quickly
But Hunter disputed this notion and in a conference call Friday talked openly about the entire season s being canceled before the players would back away from their ultimate goals
I m not at all concerned Hunter said
There s been no demonstration that there s going to be a change in our resolve
After the players saw these proposals from the league and the recent posturing by NBA owners well I had two players call me up and tell me if need be they d be willing to hock everything they ve got Another significant development may be thedeparture of many players to Europe until the dispute is settled according to at least two player agents
I think it would be a case by case basis but yes there s already some people talking about that said Bill Strickland a member of the union s agents advisory committee
Steve Kauffman another member of the committee said he would explore the possibility that one client Nets center Rony Seikaly would sign with a professional team in Greece
We wouldn t look to void his deal with the team Kauffman said
But we would want him to have the right for him to work temporarily until he could come back and honor his contract Russ Granik NBA deputy commissioner said the league has approved the idea of players earning a living elsewhere until the lockout is settled
Proposals exchanged last week that included the concept of a luxury tax system on player salaries appeared to reflect the first signs of progress in negotiations since the lockout began July 
But both sides have termed the figures in each other s proposal as unacceptable and it was unclear whether either side was willing compromise
I don t think we should get too carried away about the possibilities just yet Granik said
When they explored the idea of a tax system we were taking the players at their word that they wanted to make some headway
But to call their first proposal meaningless is charitable
They proposed something that has no impact
As it stands that can t be the solution The owners goal is to slow the growth of player salaries in relation to leaguewide revenue over the next three years while the players want to keep earning as much as possible
Despite modest encouragement over a new proposal delivered by the players to the owners the National Basketball Association Tuesday canceled the first two weeks of the regular season the first time in the league s year history that it will lose games to a labor dispute
The NBA s deputy commissioner Russ Granik announced the cancellation after nearly three and a half hours of meetings concluded at a Manhattan hotel
The decision to cancel games between Nov

came after the players association proposed the implementation of a tax system instead of a hard salary cap a proposal the owners said they would respond to by Friday

I d like to think these our the last games we have to cancel Granik said
But unless this or something else works or there s some dramatic breakthrough I think that is certainly not all of the season that s in jeopardy 
As labor battles go the current one between the National Basketball Association and its players is weird even by sports standards
There is a real possibility that most if not all of the coming season will be canceled
In this union battle it is the interests of the best paid not those who make union scale that are dominating the discussion
And here it is some of the workers not the management who are considering trying to make the union disappear
The current arrangement has produced an unbalanced pay scale of immense proportions
Last year more players than ever before received the union minimum then for rookies or for veterans
The number of players making million to million a year the middle class in NBA terms fell sharply
But Michael Jordan made million
This should not be a surprise
Sports is an entertainment business not unlike movies
Big stars get millions while most get union scale
Over the years NBA efforts to stem the rise of salaries have failed
The most important loophole in its salary cap lets a team sign its own free agent for whatever it is willing to pay
When that was adopted it was assumed that no team would pay a lot more than a rival could pay
But it has not worked out that way
In the current negotiation the league has offered to guarantee that its payroll will rise percent over the next four years from billion to billion and says it is open to proposals to split that money any way the players want whether by raising the minimum salary or guaranteeing raises for veterans
The union says it is worried about that middle class but seems determined to preserve the free market
The league got its broadcasters NBC and Time Warner s cable channels to agree to pay this year s television fees whether or not there are any games to broadcast
They will be paid back in later years either through reduced fees or extra games to show Owners hoped the players would think management was willing to wait them out and come to terms with only a small part of the season canceled
But the union is acting unhurried
It turned aside requests for negotiations this week saying the players had to meet first
Then there is the issue of union suicide a tactic that was rejected by the players in 
The idea is that if the players had no union it would be illegal under antitrust laws for the owners to collude
The sky would be the limit
That tactic might fail
The courts could reject a union decertification vote as a sham and in any case some players may fear that teams would feel free to offer less than the old union minimum
But if the players go that route it could be a long time before real negotiations get going
Billy Hunter the union s executive director warned the owners this week that a prolonged lockout could destroy the league s popularity
That was what all the seers said four years ago when baseball s World Series was canceled by labor troubles
But fan memories are relatively short and now baseball seems more popular than ever
With that in mind both owners and players may choose to battle on for months
He was the classic small town prodigy with the creativity of a big city profiteer
When there was no shot to take he invented a new one
When there was no one to pass to he reconfigured the play until a teammate was open
Larry Bird in the Indiana countryside or inside Boston Garden was a luminous exception to the governing rule
That is why six years after his retirement from the National Basketball Association his name is again basketball s most prominent beginning with his induction to the Hall of Fame before Bird watchers at the Civic Center here on Friday night
Deservedly enshrined as forever exceptional he again becomes Bird the exception the case study for a contentious and potentially disastrous labor war
No not really Bird said when I asked whether he is troubled by the likelihood of his legendary name soon representing a symbol of greed to unsympathetic millions
There s always a player s name attached to these things
I know at the time I was very happy about it That would have been when the Celtics wanted to compensate Bird with a million bonus to push through his back pain go on as their savior
Three years later in a contract arbitration involving the Knicks Patrick Ewing the agent David Falk would contend that the NBA conspired with the Celtics to circumvent the salary cap in order to satisfy Bird
Alan Greenspan I am sure would agree that this salary cap is convoluted enough to give anyone a headache so let s just say it is a cap that does not exist when a team is negotiating with one of its own
The process of unsealing the cap to re sign a particular player eventually became known as making use of the Larry Bird exception
And that is where we stand as this onetime exception has become the very expensive rule the owners don t want to play by anymore
I can understand both sides said Bird safely in the middle between Bird the former exception and Bird the present Indiana Pacers coach
Without getting into the exception I think it s very important for players to stay in the same place Important he meant for franchise stability and fan identification
You have a son who is years old he goes from to in the years you ve played Bird said
A lot of people in Boston told me that they had followed me from the time they were very young to when they were in college The Bird years numbered only three Celtics championships but he was the best player pro basketball s most famous team ever had
He and Magic Johnson created a basketball renaissance that began during a college title showdown in Salt Lake City and spread worldwide like an infectious smile
They stood for the pass for team play but now their decade of selflessness has given way to one of selfishness
The NBA of Michael Jordan reached greater heights than anyone imagined it could but it is a league that now suffers from a sickness of the soul
If Larry and Magic hadn t done what they did we might not survive what we re about to go through said Bill Fitch Bird s first Celtics coach who with Bill Walton stood with him on the night that he said gave closure to his playing career
The owners as always are exaggerating their misery but this time it is much easier to not root for the players
The president of the union is Ewing who one day commands players to boycott the world championships because the NBA s corporate fingerprints are on them then the next day helps himself to some television commentary work for David Stern s women s annex
Ewing leads the fight to protect the million contracts for year olds who have achieved not a single playoff victory linked to the big payoffs for agents like his friend Falk
The battle is waged in the name of a salary cap that makes exceptions of the unexceptional rewards everyone as if they were Bird
I believe that in any field there has to be an allowance for the truly special ones Walton said
But that group is very small
When I was growing up in this sport the only players who got the recognition were the champions the ones who always made you feel good about the game about sports
That s how Larry and Magic played always dreaming of the special team
It wasn t about hype about money That is not quite the case nor should it have been
Bird was a businessman s ball player from the day he arrived with his flannel shirts and blue collar ethic
He hired the late Bob Woolf one of the original heavy hitting agents and got himself a record rookie contract
Then he went out and turned a victory catastrophe into a victory contender
A rare Bird an honest exception to the rule
The first substantive talks in more than two months between opposing sides of the National Basketball Association s labor dispute came and went Thursday without a hint of a settlement
Still a five hour meeting that was described as cordial by the league and almost like two bulls letting off a little steam by the players association produced another scheduled round of talks next Tuesday
Barring a major compromise that will not be enough time to preserve a full season and prevent the league from losing its first regular season games to labor strife in November
Russ Granik the NBA s deputy commissioner said the league would wait until after next week s meeting before deciding to cancel regular season games
He also discussed the possibility of a significantly shortened season
We haven t made a determination that you need this exact number of games in order to have a representative season Granik said
But we recognize that beyond a certain point we can t possibly sell to our fans that we re having an NBA season
Whether s that games games or or we re not there yet
We have a few months before we have to face that decision Perhaps the only progress involved Thursday in the conference room of a midtown Manhattan hotel was a question and answer session over the league s latest proposal to the players
Patrick Ewing the union president and vice presidents Herb Williams and Dikembe Mutombo attended the meeting with the union s executive director Billy Hunter and union lawyers
No owners were present but Granik Commissioner David Stern and the league s lawyers spent most of the day explaining the intricacies of a two week old proposal to the players
At one point before the two parties broke for lunch Stern and Hunter raised their voices and accused each other of handling their constituencies poorly a participant in the meeting said
But the two were seen shaking hands and laughing after the meeting concluded shortly after pm There was some venting from both sides Hunter said
We ve been placid and very respectful
Today we took the coats off and we were inclined to take the gloves off a little bit
Having done that I think it kind of loosened up both sides Hunter added Did anybody blink today They re sort of look at us for any kind of nuance they can find during the course of negotiations that might in some way or another give some indication that while we re mouthing one thing we might be open to something else
We re looking at their body language too
I don t think that they re ready to make a deal The last formal meeting between both sides on Aug
ended when Stern and the owners abruptly marched out after they had received a proposal from the players
Patrick Ewing did not want to sound like a striking longshoreman demanding health benefits
I m not going to try and put it in dollars and cents But Ewing president of the National Basketball Association Players Association played the public relations game Tuesday by expounding on the themes of labor unrest strong willed unity and short sighted proposals
On the day when training camps were scheduled to begin players from across the country held news conferences in NBA cities to proclaim themselves ready to practice for the regular season
We want to show the public that we as players want to play said Ewing who was flanked by five teammates
Today is supposed to be the start of training camp
We want to practice and we want the season to start
But unfortunately the owners have locked us out and the season has been postponed The owners and players are scheduled hold their first bargaining session since Aug
on Thursday in Manhattan
Neither side is predicting progress toward signing a new collective bargaining agreement and beginning the season as scheduled on Nov
The league canceled the entire game preseason on Monday
Next week it will consider canceling the first ever regular season games in league history
With wide philosophical differences on how billion annual income should be distributed both sides have privately said they don t expect to play a regular season game before December
Billy Hunter the union s executive director offered a glimmer of hope
He spoke optimistically about the potential for a quick resolution
Standing a few feet away from Ewing he said I hope the owners and commissioner have gotten the message that we re serious about a deal
I m prepared to make a quantum leap
I don t think we re that far off
I think there s a lot jockeying a lot of rhetoric and a lot of games being played
But if and when the owners decide they want a deal then they ll get one But soon after he began lambasting the owners latest proposal which includes the eventual phasing out of the Larry Bird exception the clause that enables free agents to earn unlimited salaries from their current teams
That clause represents the major rift in negotiations
Owners would like to implement a restrictive salary cap that would eventually put a ceiling on how much one player can earn
I don t know if this is going to come to a speedy resolution Ewing said
They re entrenched with what they want which is a hard cap
And we feel with a hard cap we as players cannot survive
We would have to be stupid and ignorant to accept that deal Said Hunter If you go for their proposal it s just a joke
It s a step backwards
I cannot understand it
If the intent was to reach an agreement at this late stage or to negotiate in earnest this was the wrong way to go about it League officials did not respond to the players comments
All we want is our fair share and we feel like they re trying to take that away from us Ewing said
There s a perception that we re on strike
It s the other way around
We ve been locked out Besides Ewing the other Knicks included former union president Buck Williams former vice president Herb Williams Allan Houston and John Starks
Marcus Camby also showed up briefly
When the media horde closed in however the third year forward went to look for his late arriving teammates inside the practice facility
He was stopped at the gym door which was locked
They locked us out said Rockets forward Mario Elie
Everybody s got to get that corrected
It s not on us
They re the ones that closed us down The stalemate has elicited talks of possibly bringing in a mediator in the coming weeks as Major League Baseball did in to help solve its labor dispute
But the players are convinced commissioner David Stern and the owners are set on testing their resolve before any genuine headway can be made in negotiations
That means missing paychecks in November something Ewing said the players are prepared to do
Both sides are still awaiting the outcome of an arbitration decision that is due before Oct
Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more than players with million in guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout
Feerick s decision could give new leverage to one side
But if the players lose the arbitration more than athletes many with extravagant lifestyles and tremendous financial obligations will have their allegiances instantly tested
It s like they want to see how strong we are Ewing said
Based on the proposals we ve received we re very strong So far it seems as though the NBA is dug in on their position Buck Williams said
I don t think they re too concerned at this point about making a deal
He added We re about as far apart as the Grand Canyon right now 
In a critical ruling for the North American National Basketball Association and the players union arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether more than players with guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout
If the players win the owners will be liable for about dlrs million in guaranteed salaries although they have vowed to appeal if they lose
The league already has sued the players over Feerick s jurisdiction
If we win I think it just emboldens the spirit and resolve of the players union director Billy Hunter said
But I don t think there will be anybody celebrating because there s no guarantee that it will end the lockout
It only means they have to pay some players and they ve indicated to us their intent to file an immediate appeal and take it as far as they have to in order to avoid payment
So even if he does rule in our favor at most it s a hollow victory
The players aren t going to get paid Nov
in any circumstance Hunter said
If the owners win it will remove the last wild card the players had been holding
The sides have not negotiated since last Tuesday when the union proposed a superstar tax on the highest contracts
The league made a counterproposal Friday asking that the tax be imposed with a much lower threshold
Hunter dismissed the league s latest proposal on Friday afternoon then said both sides would be best served by awaiting Feerick s ruling
It s unlikely any negotiations will be held this week since the union is holding a meeting for all NBA players and the agents advisory committee in Las Vegas from Wednesday through Friday
We ve got to get a sense of where the players are what they consider to be reasonable and what they re willing to do in order to get the season to commence Hunter said
The union filed a grievance with Feerick before the lockout was imposed July over the owners announcement June that they would not honor guaranteed deals
In a six day hearing over the summer the union argued that owners should have protected themselves from being liable for guaranteed salaries during a work stoppage by inserting lockout language into the standard player contract
The Sacramento Kings inserted a lockout clause into center Olden Polynice s contract in and it was approved by the league
The union used the existence of that clause to argue that all the other teams should have protected themselves similarly
Most players are due to receive their first paychecks Nov
although a dozen or so had clauses entitling them to be paid over the summer
None has received a paycheck
The NBA argued that a tenet of labor law allows employers to withhold pay from employees during a lockout
The league also called former union director Simon Gourdine to testify but Feerick upheld union objections and prohibited Gourdine from saying whether it was his understanding when he negotiated the old labor agreement in that players would not be paid if the owners chose to reopen the agreement and impose a lockout
In a critical ruling for the North American National Basketball Association and the players union arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether more than players with guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout
If the players win the owners will be liable for about dlrs million in guaranteed salaries although they have vowed to appeal if they lose
The league already has sued the players over Feerick s jurisdiction
If we win I think it just emboldens the spirit and resolve of the players union director Billy Hunter said
But I don t think there will be anybody celebrating because there s no guarantee that it will end the lockout
It only means they have to pay some players and they ve indicated to us their intent to file an immediate appeal and take it as far as they have to in order to avoid payment
So even if he does rule in our favor at most it s a hollow victory
The players aren t going to get paid Nov
in any circumstance Hunter said
If the owners win it will remove the last wild card the players had been holding
