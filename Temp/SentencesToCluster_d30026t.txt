America Online Inc
wants to become the next Microsoft in two promising information age fields where Microsoft Corp
is just another company the Internet media business and electronic commerce
With its proposed purchase of Netscape Communications Corp AOL the nation s largest dial up online service with more than million subscribers hopes to take a significant step toward that ambitious goal
If the billion deal is completed the companies had not reached a final agreement as of Monday night AOL would acquire a leading Internet brand and enlarge its wired audience by absorbing the millions who regularly visit Netscape s popular NetCenter site on the World Wide Web
Acquiring Netscape would really enhance America Online s role as the premier Internet media company said James F
Moore president of Geopartners Inc a consulting firm
America Online is assembling the kind of audience numbers that will convince people the Internet is becoming a mainstream media In the new media business as in traditional media like television or newspapers eyeballs translate into advertising revenue
But what really intrigues media executives and consumer marketers about the new media news entertainment and services rendered in computer code is that it is inherently a two way medium with which people can interact with the tap of a key or the click of a mouse button The interaction that advertisers and marketers want to see of course is buying
And it is the potential for exploiting an instant direct connection to consumers that has fueled all the recent optimism about electronic commerce
Today companies are selling everything from books to baby clothes over the Internet
Most companies have not progressed beyond the experimentation stage but there are a handful of encouraging success stories like Amazoncom the on line bookstore
By Forrester Research Inc whose business is analyzing trends in cyberspace projects that Internet commerce could reach trillion or percent of all sales worldwide
AOL is at the forefront of this convergence of media and commerce converge and integration reflected in the lineage of its leaders
Steve Case the chairman was once a new product manager for Pepsico s Pizza Hut chain while Robert Pittman the president is a former MTV executive
Microsoft is also investing heavily in new media and electronic commerce
It has an online service MSN which competes with AOL as well as information and commerce Web sites that focus on travel cars and real estate
It also owns Sidewalk a network of local sites that list movies restaurants and stores in cities around the country including Seattle and New York
Its MSNBC Internet news service is half of a joint venture with NBC
Microsoft is expected to be a formidable competitor in the media and commerce business
It has no shortage of bright people and it has more money than any rival
Besides deep pockets Microsoft has the built in advantage in any computer based medium because its Windows operating system runs more than percent of personal computers sold today
Its control of the Windows desktop gives it the most valuable piece of commercial real estate in the information age
In theory at least owning that desktop screen should help Microsoft steer consumers to its online offerings an issue that is key to the government s antitrust suit against Microsoft
But so far Microsoft has started slowly in the fields of Internet media and electronic commerce
Microsoft may want to but it does not dominate these new markets said Richard Shaffer a principal of Technologic Partners a research firm
America Online recognizes that the big opportunity is in these emerging growth businesses like electronic commerce instead of trying to take Microsoft on head on Still if the Netscape deal is completed AOL will also find itself in the software business in a way it has never been in the past
Netscape is known as the pioneer in the commercial development of software used to navigate the World Wide Web
Microsoft saw the browser software as a direct threat to its industry dominance and pursued that market aggressively bundling its own browser with its Windows and giving it away free tactics that have been challenged by the government
But Netscape no longer generates revenues from its browser which it now also distributes for free but from the sale of heavy duty software sold to corporations
Much of this software is used as the technological back office for electronic commerce used in building Web sites and processing transactions
A surprising element in the proposed deal is that AOL intends to hold onto Netscape s corporate software business instead of selling it off to an established software company
America Online just doesn t have credibility in that market observed Michael A
Cusumano a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology s Sloan School of Management
Executives close to AOL explain the decision as the need to provide full line offerings for electronic commerce from corporate Web site to the computer screens of consumers
But AOL has decided it needs help to preserve and strengthen Netscape s corporate software business
To do that it has brought in Sun Microsystems Inc
in a side deal which has complicated the transaction considerably
AOL according to executives close to the proposed deal will own Netscape but it will have a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun
As part of the deal AOL will agree to purchase about million worth of Sun s computers for its service while Sun will apparently agree to purchase sizeable amounts of Netscape software which Sun s sales force must sell
Still AOL and Sun have a longer term objective as well one that promises to place them in more direct conflict with Microsoft
For nearly a year William J
Raduchel Sun s chief strategist has been working closely with AOL according to Sun executives
A former Harvard economics professor who taught Scott McNealy the Sun chairman Raduchel has focused on Sun s Internet programming technologies called Java and Jini both of which are seen as potential threats to Microsoft s dominance
By combining Sun s technology prowess with AOL s powerful consumer brand the Sun executives say there is the potential for a kind end run around Microsoft s grip on desktop computing
In its research laboratories Sun has been working on a stripped down network computer a simple to use information appliance which could cost as little as or be given away as part of a subscription service
The concept is that AOL s Internet media and electronic commerce services could be delivered to many more homes than today because many people still shun the expense and difficulty of using a personal computer
The appliance would be mainly a receiver and screen with most of the computing power residing on vast central computers serving up information as users request by tapping a few buttons
Sun s technological specialty is this kind of centralized network computing
If the long term AOL Sun vision ever materialized certainly a three to five year bet at the least it could give both companies a boost and technological independence from Microsoft
America Online built itself into the most potent force in cyberspace largely by appealing to families with chatty teen agers who want to flirt online and adults looking for an easy way to send electronic mail while checking the weather and sports scores
Now the company has to get serious if it is to win the hearts and minds of corporate executives in pin stripe suits
Nearly lost in the complexity of America Online s deal to buy Netscape Communication Corp
is America Online s announcement that it will enter an entirely new market working behind the computer screen to help companies open and operate online stores
Netscape already has created software that made it a player in providing support for what is already known as electronic commerce
But America Online now says it has ambitions to offer a much wider array of software consulting and services for online merchants
Most companies that sell to consumers realize that they need to get into the e commerce space said America Online president Robert Pittman in a news conference Tuesday
We see a major business in offering them an end to end solution The market is big and growing bigger by the day
Forrester Research estimates that million will be spent this year on electronic commerce software and another billion on services that range from graphic design to the turn key operation of entire online stores
By Forrester estimates the combined market for electronic commerce services and software should top billion
E commerce services are the silver bullet that will enable companies to be able to take advantage of the true business opportunities on the Web said Traci Gere an analyst at International Data Corp
The market is growing very rapidly but it is very fragmented Analysts say the leader today in e commerce services is IBM which has a full line of offerings from sophisticated software products to hand holding consulting
Other competitors include well known information technology consulting companies such as Andersen Consulting the spin off from the Arthur Andersen accounting firm Electronic Data Systems which runs computer systems for big companies and PricewaterhouseCoopers which offers accounting and consulting separately but under one umbrella
Software companies like Microsoft and Netscape sell packaged programs typically with little or no consulting to help customers use them
There are also plenty of new companies that have sprouted up to provide electronic commerce services
Some like AgencyCom and Organic Online started basically as advertising and design firms
Others including U S Web and Viant have emphasized programming and consulting
In fact those two strains are blurring together as exemplified by U S Web s pending merger with CKS Group
America Online argues that its advantage in this increasingly crowded bazaar is its ability to combine a broad subscriber base of about million customers with Netscape software plus hardware from Sun Microsystems which has joined in America Online s venture into electronic commerce engineering
This is the first time anyone has put a true end to end solution that starts with the silicon and ends with the audience said Barry Schuler America Online s president for interactive services
We start with Sun s line of servers then the commerce tools to build a store the support services to process orders and then a deal for online real estate that can drive the traffic Despite the advantages Netscape and Sun bring analysts say that America Online faces a variety of problems in its new quest
Chief among them is whether it can appear to have the consistency focus and follow through that corporate customers demand
AOL is not the first company that comes to my mind when it comes to business quality software said Robert Chatham a senior analyst with Forrester Research
Its decision to keep Netscape as a separate unit and offer electronic commerce services in partnership with Sun will not enhance its credibility Chatham said
America Online doesn t look like a homogenous vendor he added
It looks like customers will have to tangle with a menage a trois of AOL Netscape and Sun Nor have Internet service providers and other telecommunications oriented companies shown much evidence Ms Gere of International Data said that they are capable of offering the highly specific customized services that big corporate clients demand
Telecommunications companies that try to do things efficiently for a large number of customers have not been able to offer customized one to one relationships she said
Pittman said that America Online had been driven to the e commerce business because companies that approached it wanting to sell their goods needed more help than simply advertising online
We are finding people who are expert in running bricks and mortar stores are limited by their infrastructure he said
They have an online store but their square footage is too small Even before the Netscape deal America Online was moving to provide some electronic commerce software and services
It has been rewriting the software that lets companies open online stores to be based on universally accepted Internet standards rather than the specific computer language used only on America Online
This new software which now will be combined with Netscape s online store services will be available for companies to use both on America Online and on the Internet
Similarly it has developed a service that lets users create a file with their credit card numbers and shipping address so they can make online purchases without retyping all that information each time
America Online is working to offer it for a fee to stores on the broader Internet
There is a wide range of services that are incorporated in electronic commerce
These include high end strategy consulting to help companies decide whether and how to sell online without hurting their traditional sale in stores
There are all sorts of computer systems to be developed ranging from the online stores themselves to connecting those sites to a company s existing inventory and accounting systems
The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday Nov
America Online s effort to acquire Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun Microsystems is a reminder of how rapidly the corporate landscape can change in fast moving technical fields
But it does not lessen the need for the Justice Department to vigorously pursue its antitrust suit against Microsoft the dominant player in software
The department has presented solid evidence that Microsoft has used its monopoly in operating systems to muscle rivals and partners so as to head off competition in other software realms
The Internet has risen so quickly as an information medium that only four years ago in his book The Road Ahead Bill Gates scarcely mentions it
In addition only a couple of years ago America Online the world s biggest online service was having so much trouble getting rid of the bugs in the system it was widely derided as America On Hold Now Microsoft has moved so aggressively into the Internet that the Justice Department is accusing it of predatory behavior and America Online has rocketed forward to make deals with other Internet players
In its antitrust suit against Microsoft the federal government charges that the company has illegally bundled its own browser with its Windows operating system to smother Netscape s chances of marketing its browser
Now in the corridors outside the antitrust trial Microsoft s lawyers maintain that Netscape has found a new partner in America Online and has no need of protection from the government
But it could be as easily argued that Microsoft has bludgeoned Netscape into dissolution forcing a distress sale to America Online
Nor is it clear that customers of America Online will choose Netscape s browser as a vehicle for buying and selling on the Internet
Even in its newly musclebound form America Online remains dependent on Microsoft s good will for favorable placement of an AOL icon on the main desktop screen
It may be that years hence America Online Netscape and Sun will put together an alternative means to the Internet through telephone lines cables or the like
But until that day fairness requires Justice Department action to insure that Microsoft not use its current position to thwart consumer choice
Only when companies know they can get their products to the consumer will they have the incentive to innovate and turn the Internet into the revolutionary medium it promises to be
America Online built itself into the most potent force in cyberspace largely by appealing to families with chatty teen agers who want to flirt online and adults looking for an easy way to send electronic mail while checking the weather and sports scores

There are creative services that include graphic design media buying customer list analysis and other marketing and promotional efforts
And there are operational services that involve actually maintaining the big servers that users connect to when they use the online stores that display catalogs take orders and process payments
America Online Schuler said will emphasize services that relate to marketing rather than back office functions
We will consult on how to merchandise and sell online he said
We understand the consumer piece of the puzzle Some competitors worry that America Online s electronic commerce services may simply be a device to sell its software and hardware
The challenge is to prove that clients are getting the best possible solution for their business said Robert Gett the chief executive of Viant
If they offer AOL and Netscape and Sun their answer is a bit tainted Netscape does have an expanding force of about people who provide consulting and custom programming
But they have been most competitive Gett said in competing for nuts and bolts projects rather than the more lucrative assignments to develop and carry out a full fledged strategy on the Web
They say Who knows our software better than Netscape Gett said
We help customers decide which platform is best for them But America Online argues that the combined might of it Netscape and Sun is just what the business needs
We always believed that commerce that is buying goods and services is the huge revenue stream of the future Schuler said
We have only seen the tiniest tip of the iceberg 
Envisioning a thoroughly networked world in which the World Wide Web is a limitless marketplace of information entertainment products and services America Online Inc
Tuesday laid out the details of its agreement to buy the Netscape Communications Corporation for billion
By moving quickly toward what both companies have recently come to see as the inevitable convergence of technology and media America Online hopes that it will secure a solid lead in a battle already joined by giants like the Microsoft Corp
and the International Business Machines Corp
to transform the greater part of cyberspace into a vast virtual mall
Part of that vision rests on an alliance with Sun Microsystems that America Online negotiated as part of the deal
Sun not only brings a cyber savvy sales force to the effort but even more importantly a strong technology partner in developing Netscape s industrial strength software for running Internet sites
Sun is indeed a technology heavyweight
It owns the Java programming language specially designed for Internet applications and Solaris among the most popular commercial operating systems for the powerful computers that big corporations use to serve up Internet services like the World Wide Web e mail and retail transactions
It also manufactures a highly respected line of powerful computers based on its own microprocessor chips
But for America Online and for the big Internet players against which it will compete the real potential gold mine lies further down the road perhaps five years away when people will venture on line for information or shopping not only from personal computers but from inexpensive Internet appliances costing each or maybe included free as part of a subscription service just as some cellular phones are now
Today being wired remains a comparatively elitist activity an estimated percent of American households had access to the Internet last year and percent of households bought merchandise on line
But the executives at America Online and Netscape hope that their deal will accelerate the timetable for the day when the Net is ubiquitous when people will tap into the World Wide Web from appliance like devices pagers cell phones television set top boxes or computers as routinely as they use the telephone today
A new generation of Internet devices to be able to deliver our service anywhere is a key part of what this deal is about in the long run said Stephen M
Case the chairman of America Online
For the present however the idea is to make America Online the nation s leading online service the standard way to get onto the Internet the executives explained
Netscape the Internet pioneer is a crucial part of that effort they said
There is no assurance that this vision of the technological future will prove accurate or even if it does that the America Online Netscape combination will lead the way
Still the long range game plan helps explain what brought America Online and Netscape together
And the ability of the companies executives to sell that vision to Netscape s whiz kid programmers in particular will determine whether the merger succeeds
Netscape s headquarters in Mountain View Calif is likely become a prime target for Silicon Valley headhunters
As is the case with any software company Netscape s key asset is its talented programmers and many of these code hackers may be reluctant to work for America Online which still has a reputation as a middle brow service catering to online newcomers known derisively as newbies Stock options and other financial incentives will be tailored to try to keep Netscape employees on board
But these people want to change the world and we ve got to be clear that joining with America Online along with the Sun component really is a bigger opportunity for us said Marc Andreessen the year old cofounder of Netscape who led a team of young programmers from the supercomputing center at the University of Illinois to Silicon Valley to start the Internet software company in 
This ought to be the preeminent Internet company over the next decade Andreessen declared speaking from a cell phone on a streetcorner in Palo Alto Calif
For his part Andreessen a Netscape executive vice president will become Netscape s chief technology officer for the next three or four months until the merger is completed
His new job at America Online has not yet been determined but it is likely to be chief technology officer of the combined company as well an America Online executive said
Already according to one Netscape board member Andreessen has delivered a page single spaced memorandum to Case setting out his view of the technological road map the new company should follow into the future emphasizing the opportunities for electronic commerce in an environment in which most people are linked to the Internet
Netscape populated with computing sophisticates and America Online known as an on ramp to the Internet for the technologically challenged seem a corporate odd couple
But the two companies its executives explained had been evolving toward each other for more than a year
In a telephone interview from America Online s headquarters in Dulles Va Case described Netscape as an enterprise that had morphed itself from a company dependent on sales of its software used to browse the World Wide Web and in Microsoft s cross hairs into a business that relied on advertising and other revenues from its popular Netcenter Web site and from selling software to corporations to handle electronic commerce
The Netscape transformation was largely a reaction to Microsoft s competitive assault on its browser business a central element in the government s antitrust suit against Microsoft
Microsoft bundled its browser into its industry standard Windows operating system and gave away the browser for free
The government alleges these steps were part of a pattern of anticompetitive practices while Microsoft maintains the moves were intended mainly to benefit consumers
Early this year after laying off workers and suffering a large loss last year Netscape announced that it would also distribute its browser for free
It seems to have stabilized its business around its new model
Netscape announced Tuesday that it earned million on revenues of million in its fourth fiscal quarter which ended in September
Yet America Online has also changed in the last couple of years moving well beyond its reputation as an online service for beginners
It now has an Internet chat service and runs its own all in one site on the Web known as a portal which includes e mail Internet searching news entertainment and online shopping
America Online has really changed from a closed online service for novice users to an Internet media and technology company with a diverse set of brands Andreessen said
These two companies have been moving in the same direction and the fit is a good one 
Microsoft Corp
argued in federal court Monday that the proposed acquisition of Netscape Communications Corp
by America Online seriously undermined the government s antitrust suit against the software giant
From a legal standpoint this proposed deal pulls the rug out from under the government William Neukom Microsoft s senior vice president for legal affairs said Monday morning on the courthouse steps
The reasoning behind this assertion Microsoft says is that the proposed deal demonstrates that Netscape and the larger software industry are healthy and vibrant even with all of the illegal and anti competitive practices alleged in the government s suit
But David Boies the government s lead attorney said all of that was irrelevant
Whatever the deal ends up being if there ends up being a deal is not going to remove any of the obstacles that Microsoft has placed in the path of competition in this industry he said
Michael Lacovara a Microsoft lawyer who was questioning a government witness economist Frederick Warren Boulton suggested to him during the trial Monday that the proposed acquisition undermined Warren Boulton s argument that Microsoft seems headed toward obtaining a monopoly in Internet browser software to match the one it apparently holds in operating systems
After all about percent of Americans who use the Internet reach it through America Online
And at present AOL uses Microsoft s Web browser Internet Explorer as the service s default choice
In exchange for that Microsoft places an AOL advertisement and Internet link in Windows 
Lacovara asked the witness whether once AOL s service contract expires in January he would expect AOL to continue to distribute Microsoft software Yes Warren Boulton responded
It is not at all clear to me that AOL s incentive to do this is changed by this proposed merger with Netscape He noted that America Online officials had said their need to be among the online services featured in Windows forced them to accept Microsoft terms establishing Internet Explorer as the default choice
Lacovara then asked Warren Boulton the question that lay under his entire cross examination of the witness and Microsoft s larger assertion Monday about the proposed Netscape AOL deal
Surely this combination he asked tells you something about the nature of competition in the software industry Warren Boulton s answer was probably not the one Lacovara had been after
To the extent that this potential merger is the result of Microsoft s actions with these exclusive contracts and other actions he said it is unfortunate to see the disappearance of a firm like Netscape the brightest newest star Warren Boulton s purpose on the stand for the government is to establish that Microsoft does have a monopoly in operating system software more than percent of the world s computers use a Microsoft operating system
That is the foundation under most of the government s case since federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior by a monopolist that would be legal for a firm that faces healthy competition
Through repeated often circumlocutious questioning Lacovara tried to make the case that Microsoft s overwhelming market share was ephemeral
The software industry is so vibrant and fast moving he suggested that Microsoft could be toppled from its position at any moment a point of view the company encourages among its employees
On Friday and Monday Lacovara repeatedly pointed out that other companies are placing other operating systems on the market and some software companies principally Microsoft s greatest rivals are writing software for these new systems
But Warren Boulton argued that the existence of these fringe competitors in the operating system market does not mean in any way that Microsoft does not have monopoly power On Monday afternoon Lacovara made an issue of the success Apple Computer Co
is having selling its new iMac computer
He entered into evidence an Apple news release issued last month showing among other things that percent of the people buying Apple s new iMac computer had previously owned a Windows machine
Apple computers use a different operating system Mac OS
