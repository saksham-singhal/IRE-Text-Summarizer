Annan s one day nd graf pvs
TRIPOLI Libya AP UN Secretary General Kofi Annan arrived in Libya Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan suspects in the Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie Scotland
Annan s one day visit to meet with Libyan leader Col
Moammar Gadhafi followed reports in the Libyan media that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the suspects
This position would indicate that Gadhafi is giving himself enough diplomatic room in the event he decides against giving up the suspects
Annan flew aboard a special plane from the Tunisian resort island of Jerba after receiving a clearance from the UN Sanctions Committee to make the flight
A Libyan official speaking on condition of anonymity said Annan had arrived in the country but refused to give details
Libyan media controlled by the government did not report on the visit in a sign that the subject is of great sensitivity
It was not known where Annan will meet with Gadhafi but diplomats said Friday the meeting will likely take place in the northern coastal town of Sirte kilometers miles east of the Libyan capital of Tripoli
Libya has been under UN sanctions since for its refusal to hand over the two alleged intelligence agents Abdel Basset Ali al Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah
They are accused by the United States and Britain of blowing up a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish village of Lockerbie on Dec
All people aboard the Boeing and people on ground were killed
A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan s legal counsel to discuss a US British proposal to try the suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using Scottish judges
Dutch authorities say they have made arrangements to hold the trial at Camp Zeist a former air force base near Utrecht
On Friday Annan said the UN team has done some good work on the Lockerbie dossier We will try to resolve some problems and to find solutions together once and for all Annan said
But in an apparent bid to distance the Libyan leader from a decision on the suspects Libya s official news agency JANA said Friday that Gadhafi is neither president nor prime minister nor foreign minister but only the leader of the Libyan revolution As such Col
Gadhafi is not empowered to sign an agreement the report said
JANA suggested that a decision on handing over the suspects would have to be approved by some grassroots national committees before being decided by the Parliament
The Netherlands was chosen as a venue for the trial after Libya itself proposed the trial be held in a third country
Since then a new hurdle has cropped up over the imprisonment of the suspects if convicted
Libya wants them jailed in the Netherlands or Libya but the United States and Britain say they should be imprisoned in Scotland and refuse to negotiate the issue
The UN sanctions on Libya do not cover oil exports Libya s economic lifeblood
They ban air travel to and from the country and arms sales
Some Libyan assets abroad have also been frozen
But many African countries have defied the air ban and their leaders have flown in and out of Libya
Qatar s foreign minister Sheik Hamad bin Jassem bin Jaber Al Thani met Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in the desert on Saturday Libya s official television reported
The television monitored in Cairo did not say where the meeting took place but it showed Gadhafi dressed in a muddy brown gown and matching cap receiving the Qatari minister in a tent
Al Thani handed Gadhafi a letter that reaffirmed Qatar s support for Libya in its just position toward the so called Lockerbie case the television said referring to Libya s objections to the UN sanctions imposed in to press it to hand over two Libyans wanted for the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie that left people dead
The television gave no other details about the visit
Louis Farrakhan the leader of a US Muslim group met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday and congratulated him on his recovery from a hip injury state run Libyan radio reported
Improved health will enable Gadhafi to carry on his leading role in the service of Islamic causes in the world Farrakhan was quoted as saying by the radio monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp
Later state run television showed Gadhafi dressed in a brown robe and holding a cane meeting Farrakhan at his ceremonial tent in the Libyan capital Tripoli
The broadcast was monitored in Cairo
Gadhafi underwent surgery last July after injuring his hip reportedly while exercising
The visit was Farrakhan s fifth to Libya in the past three years
The leader of the US based Nation of Islam most recently visited in December 
It was not immediately clear how Farrakhan arrived in Libya or how long he would stay
Most visitors arrive by ferry from Malta or travel overland from Egypt or Tunisia UN sanctions imposed in ban air travel to and from the country
Farrakhan repeatedly has urged an end to the sanctions which were imposed to try to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie Scotland that killed people
Citing the sanctions and US regulations the Treasury Department prohibited Farrakhan from accepting a dlrs prize he was awarded by Gadhafi in September for human rights work
The Treasury also barred his group from accepting Gadhafi s offer of a dlrs billion gift for Nation of Islam activities
His Nation of Islam is a black nationalist group that says it is guided by the Koran
It is not considered a true Muslim sect by others who practice Islam
Farrakhan s message to America s black community is one of self reliance discipline spirituality and separatism
Over the years he has said that whites and blacks should live separately that Jews are bloodsuckers who have a gutter religion and that whites are subhuman He accuses news media of taking his comments out of context
Libya s justice minister on Wednesday said the two suspects in the bombing of a Pan Am jetliner should not become victims of Western politics when they go on trial
We want to be sure that the only aim of the trial is to show the truth and that it is held without a political or security background Justice Minister Mohammed Belgasim al Zuwiy said
He was addressing the General People s Congress or Parliament which opened a debate that will decide the fate of the two men who are wanted in connection with the Dec
bombing
A total of people on board and on ground were killed when the jetliner blew up over the Scottish town of Lockerbie
Libya has accepted in principle to a trial before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands
But the hand over of the suspects has been held up over Libya s demand for a guarantee that the two men if convicted will be jailed in Libya
The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects serve their prison term in Britain
The Parliament meeting expected to last five days is being held in the northern coastal town of Sirte and was broadcast live on national television
Libyan media have suggested that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi does not have the authority to hand over the suspects and that any decision would have to be approved by the Congress
Our argument is that since this is an exceptional trial therefore this exception should include serving the jail term in Libya maybe under UN supervision al Zuwiy said
He said Libya is seeking the guarantees from the West to ensure that the trial will be honest just and without loopholes that would leave our citizens in illegal unjust and inappropriate circumstances Opening the debate Foreign Minister Omar al Muntasser gave the background to the controversy since the Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya in to force it to hand over the Lockerbie suspects for trial
The sanctions include a ban on air travel from and to Libya restricting diplomatic personnel and banning the purchase of oil equipment
Al Zuwiy the justice minister said the two suspects will have the right to an appeal in the same court if it finds them guilty
On Saturday UN Secretary General Kofi Annan met with Gadhafi to iron out the details
No agreement was reached but Annan said Libya is expected to reach a decision soon
After meeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in a desert tent UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said he thinks an arrangement for bringing two suspects to trial in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner could be secured in the not too distant future Annan s comments came Saturday after he and Gadhafi failed to agree on handing over Abdel Basset Ali al Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah who are suspected in the bombing that killed people
Annan spoke to reporters in the Libyan capital of Tripoli after the meeting and again later when he arrived back at this Tunisian island where he had begun his hour stretch of diplomacy
The year old Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a US British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the Dec
bombing over Lockerbie Scotland
The talks have been fruitful and positive Annan said in Tripoli
Libya has confirmed its seriousness and readiness to find a solution to the Lockerbie problem
Libya has also agreed to a trial in a third country and believes that it ought to be possible to find answers to all other outstanding issues he said
So I hope that in the not too distant future we will be able to give the families good news he added referring to the relatives of victims who have lobbied extensively for a trial

Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi began a surprise visit to neighboring Tunisia on Monday his first known trip since injuring his hip in July
Col
Gadhafi whose country is under a UN air embargo arrived by land for a visit of brotherhood and rest at the invitation of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali an official statement said
Tunisian television did not show the Libyan leader but said he met with Ben Ali and several government ministers in a desert oasis at Tozeur kms miles south of Tunis where foreign leaders are entertained
Officials however did not give the duration or full itinerary of Gadhafi s visit
The trip was not announced in advance though Ben Ali extended the invitation to Gadhafi when he visited Libya in August
Gadhafi was first driven to Gabes kms miles south of Tunis after crossing the border at Ras Jedir where he was met by Interior Minister Ali Chaouch officials said
It was Gadhafi s first known trip abroad since he broke a bone near his hip while exercising and underwent surgery in July officials have said
The Libyan leader last visited Tunisia in January when he met Ban Ali in the southern town of Medenine
Since Libya has struggled with UN Security Council sanctions that ban direct flights to and from the country
The move was aimed at forcing Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the bombing of a Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie Scotland that killed people
The council has agreed to suspend the sanctions once Libya turns the men over for a trial by Scottish judges according to Scottish law in the Netherlands under a US British proposal
Gadhafi has offered to hand them over but demands any sentences be served in Dutch or Libyan prisons
With the mournful lament of bagpipes and prayers of healing the people of Lockerbie paid tribute to the people killed when a bomb brought Pan Am Flight crashing down on this tiny town years ago Monday
The hundreds who packed Dryfesdale Parish Church heard messages from British Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President Bill Clinton who renewed their vows to punish the culprits who hid the bomb in a suitcase on Dec
But they also heard quiet sobs that echoed throughout the century old church as a few moments of silence were observed before the bagpiper blew her lament
In the lives that were lost some very young there was meaning and achievement the Rev
David Almond told the gathering of about people which included family members of those who perished
Our task in commemoration is to continue that meaning and to build on that achievement The congregation heard the children of the local elementary school sing a tribute Let There be Love as well as a message from the queen
We pray on this anniversary that the families will find solace together in quiet remembrance across the world the queen s message said
In a separate service in London s Westminster Abbey attended by Blair Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Prince Andrew the second son of Queen Elizabeth II hundreds listened as one by one the names of the passengers and of Lockerbie s own residents were read out as a candle was lit for each
Simultaneous services were also held at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia and in Syracuse New York which lost college students in the crash
Each service began at pm GMT the moment when the plane disappeared from the radar screen above Scotland
This was a very positive emotional day Bert Ammerman of River Vale New Jersey whose brother Thomas died in the crash said after the service
He said the people of Lockerbie have proven over the past years that good intentions can overcome evil Earlier in the day Prince Philip the queen s husband laid a wreath in Lockerbie s cemetery where the town s Roman Catholic parish priest at the time of the crash spoke to about victims relatives and townspeople about the ticking bomb of justice
Ten years ago for you and for us a bomb was ticking the Rev
Pat Keegans told the crowd many of them visibly moved
Be assured of this there is another bomb ticking the irresistible bomb of justice and truth
Be certain that our wreath laying today is not a symbolic gesture
It is a declaration that we will not rest until we have justice and truth until all who are responsible for your deaths are held accountable he said
Two Libyan suspects have been indicted in connection with the bombing but have not yet been turned over for trial
Last week Libya s Parliament gave its conditional approval for a trial in the Netherlands by a Scottish court but said some obstacles remained
The plane had just reached its cruising altitude of feet kms minutes after taking off from London s Heathrow Airport for New York when it exploded in the night sky
The aircraft was felled by a small amount of high explosives smuggled on in a portable radio hidden inside a suitcase which made its way as checked baggage from Malta to Frankfurt Germany and then to London
Secretary General Kofi Annan said Wednesday he was extending his North African tour to include talks with Libyan authorities
The remark was made without elaboration at a news conference in Algiers hours before his arrival in Tunis his final scheduled stop on a tour aimed at unblocking plans for a UN referendum on the disputed Western Sahara
During his visit to Tunis Annan is to meet with authorities here to discuss major regional and international issues and the various initiatives aimed at solving unresolved problems according to the local press
A Western diplomat speaking in Algiers on condition of anonymity said Annan would travel to Libya on Saturday to meet with authorities there on the Pan Am bombing that has led to UN sanctions against Libya
Annan s trip to Tunisia is scheduled to end Friday according to the official program
The discrepancy in the timing could not be immediately clarified
The UN Security Council imposed sanctions in including a flight ban to try to force Libya to hand over two suspects in the bombing that killed people
The sanctions ban flights to and from the country
Neighboring Tunisia provides a land route for those traveling to Libya from the region
A week ago before leaving for North Africa Annan held out the possibility of a Libyan trip but only to help close a deal to try the two suspects
A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan s legal counsel to discuss a US British proposal to try the suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using Scottish judges
Annan had said last week that he had hoped for a breakthrough in the case by the end of November
He said then that a trip to Libya to bring the issue finally to closure has not been excluded During his Algerian stay
