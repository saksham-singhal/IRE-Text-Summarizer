A former Harvard economics professor who taught Scott McNealy the Sun chairman Raduchel has focused on Sun s Internet programming technologies called Java and Jini both of which are seen as potential threats to Microsoft s dominance$0
AOL according to executives close to the proposed deal will own Netscape but it will have a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun$0
America Online argues that its advantage in this increasingly crowded bazaar is its ability to combine a broad subscriber base of about million customers with Netscape software plus hardware from Sun Microsystems which has joined in America Online s venture into electronic commerce engineering$0
America Online argues that its advantage in this increasingly crowded bazaar is its ability to combine a broad subscriber base of about million customers with Netscape software plus hardware from Sun Microsystems which has joined in America Online s venture into electronic commerce engineering$0
America Online s effort to acquire Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun Microsystems is a reminder of how rapidly the corporate landscape can change in fast moving technical fields$0
And the ability of the companies executives to sell that vision to Netscape s whiz kid programmers in particular will determine whether the merger succeeds$0
As part of the deal AOL will agree to purchase about million worth of Sun s computers for its service while Sun will apparently agree to purchase sizeable amounts of Netscape software which Sun s sales force must sell$0
But AOL has decided it needs help to preserve and strengthen Netscape s corporate software business$0
But it could be as easily argued that Microsoft has bludgeoned Netscape into dissolution forcing a distress sale to America Online$0
By combining Sun s technology prowess with AOL s powerful consumer brand the Sun executives say there is the potential for a kind end run around Microsoft s grip on desktop computing$0
Cusumano a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology s Sloan School of Management$0
For his part Andreessen a Netscape executive vice president will become Netscape s chief technology officer for the next three or four months until the merger is completed$0
His new job at America Online has not yet been determined but it is likely to be chief technology officer of the combined company as well an America Online executive said$0
If the long term AOL Sun vision ever materialized certainly a three to five year bet at the least it could give both companies a boost and technological independence from Microsoft$0
If they offer AOL and Netscape and Sun their answer is a bit tainted Netscape does have an expanding force of about people who provide consulting and custom programming$0
It looks like customers will have to tangle with a menage a trois of AOL Netscape and Sun Nor have Internet service providers and other telecommunications oriented companies shown much evidence Ms Gere of International Data said that they are capable of offering the highly specific customized services that big corporate clients demand$0

It may be that years hence America Online Netscape and Sun will put together an alternative means to the Internet through telephone lines cables or the like$0
Netscape populated with computing sophisticates and America Online known as an on ramp to the Internet for the technologically challenged seem a corporate odd couple$0
Now the company has to get serious if it is to win the hearts and minds of corporate executives in pin stripe suits$0
Now the company has to get serious if it is to win the hearts and minds of corporate executives in pin stripe suits$0
Part of that vision rests on an alliance with Sun Microsystems that America Online negotiated as part of the deal$0
Raduchel Sun s chief strategist has been working closely with AOL according to Sun executives$0
Sun is indeed a technology heavyweight$0
Sun not only brings a cyber savvy sales force to the effort but even more importantly a strong technology partner in developing Netscape s industrial strength software for running Internet sites$0
The challenge is to prove that clients are getting the best possible solution for their business said Robert Gett the chief executive of Viant$0
There is no assurance that this vision of the technological future will prove accurate or even if it does that the America Online Netscape combination will lead the way$0
They say Who knows our software better than Netscape Gett said$0
We help customers decide which platform is best for them But America Online argues that the combined might of it Netscape and Sun is just what the business needs$0
A surprising element in the proposed deal is that AOL intends to hold onto Netscape s corporate software business instead of selling it off to an established software company$1

America Online recognizes that the big opportunity is in these emerging growth businesses like electronic commerce instead of trying to take Microsoft on head on Still if the Netscape deal is completed AOL will also find itself in the software business in a way it has never been in the past$1
By moving quickly toward what both companies have recently come to see as the inevitable convergence of technology and media America Online hopes that it will secure a solid lead in a battle already joined by giants like the Microsoft Corp$1

As is the case with any software company Netscape s key asset is its talented programmers and many of these code hackers may be reluctant to work for America Online which still has a reputation as a middle brow service catering to online newcomers known derisively as newbies Stock options and other financial incentives will be tailored to try to keep Netscape employees on board$13
But the two companies its executives explained had been evolving toward each other for more than a year$13
But these people want to change the world and we ve got to be clear that joining with America Online along with the Sun component really is a bigger opportunity for us said Marc Andreessen the year old cofounder of Netscape who led a team of young programmers from the supercomputing center at the University of Illinois to Silicon Valley to start the Internet software company in $13
Case the chairman of America Online$13
For the present however the idea is to make America Online the nation s leading online service the standard way to get onto the Internet the executives explained$13
In addition only a couple of years ago America Online the world s biggest online service was having so much trouble getting rid of the bugs in the system it was widely derided as America On Hold Now Microsoft has moved so aggressively into the Internet that the Justice Department is accusing it of predatory behavior and America Online has rocketed forward to make deals with other Internet players$13

Already according to one Netscape board member Andreessen has delivered a page single spaced memorandum to Case setting out his view of the technological road map the new company should follow into the future emphasizing the opportunities for electronic commerce in an environment in which most people are linked to the Internet$2
America Online has really changed from a closed online service for novice users to an Internet media and technology company with a diverse set of brands Andreessen said$2
But for America Online and for the big Internet players against which it will compete the real potential gold mine lies further down the road perhaps five years away when people will venture on line for information or shopping not only from personal computers but from inexpensive Internet appliances costing each or maybe included free as part of a subscription service just as some cellular phones are now$2
But the executives at America Online and Netscape hope that their deal will accelerate the timetable for the day when the Net is ubiquitous when people will tap into the World Wide Web from appliance like devices pagers cell phones television set top boxes or computers as routinely as they use the telephone today$2
But what really intrigues media executives and consumer marketers about the new media news entertainment and services rendered in computer code is that it is inherently a two way medium with which people can interact with the tap of a key or the click of a mouse button The interaction that advertisers and marketers want to see of course is buying$2

In a telephone interview from America Online s headquarters in Dulles Va Case described Netscape as an enterprise that had morphed itself from a company dependent on sales of its software used to browse the World Wide Web and in Microsoft s cross hairs into a business that relied on advertising and other revenues from its popular Netcenter Web site and from selling software to corporations to handle electronic commerce$2

And at present AOL uses Microsoft s Web browser Internet Explorer as the service s default choice$5
Apple computers use a different operating system Mac OS$5
Besides deep pockets Microsoft has the built in advantage in any computer based medium because its Windows operating system runs more than percent of personal computers sold today$5
But Netscape no longer generates revenues from its browser which it now also distributes for free but from the sale of heavy duty software sold to corporations$5
But Warren Boulton argued that the existence of these fringe competitors in the operating system market does not mean in any way that Microsoft does not have monopoly power On Monday afternoon Lacovara made an issue of the success Apple Computer Co$5
But it does not lessen the need for the Justice Department to vigorously pursue its antitrust suit against Microsoft the dominant player in software$5
But until that day fairness requires Justice Department action to insure that Microsoft not use its current position to thwart consumer choice$5
Early this year after laying off workers and suffering a large loss last year Netscape announced that it would also distribute its browser for free$5
Even in its newly musclebound form America Online remains dependent on Microsoft s good will for favorable placement of an AOL icon on the main desktop screen$5
From a legal standpoint this proposed deal pulls the rug out from under the government William Neukom Microsoft s senior vice president for legal affairs said Monday morning on the courthouse steps$5
He entered into evidence an Apple news release issued last month showing among other things that percent of the people buying Apple s new iMac computer had previously owned a Windows machine$5
In exchange for that Microsoft places an AOL advertisement and Internet link in Windows $5
In its antitrust suit against Microsoft the federal government charges that the company has illegally bundled its own browser with its Windows operating system to smother Netscape s chances of marketing its browser$5
In theory at least owning that desktop screen should help Microsoft steer consumers to its online offerings an issue that is key to the government s antitrust suit against Microsoft$5
It is not at all clear to me that AOL s incentive to do this is changed by this proposed merger with Netscape He noted that America Online officials had said their need to be among the online services featured in Windows forced them to accept Microsoft terms establishing Internet Explorer as the default choice$5
Its control of the Windows desktop gives it the most valuable piece of commercial real estate in the information age$5
Lacovara asked the witness whether once AOL s service contract expires in January he would expect AOL to continue to distribute Microsoft software Yes Warren Boulton responded$5
Lacovara then asked Warren Boulton the question that lay under his entire cross examination of the witness and Microsoft s larger assertion Monday about the proposed Netscape AOL deal$5
Michael Lacovara a Microsoft lawyer who was questioning a government witness economist Frederick Warren Boulton suggested to him during the trial Monday that the proposed acquisition undermined Warren Boulton s argument that Microsoft seems headed toward obtaining a monopoly in Internet browser software to match the one it apparently holds in operating systems$5
Microsoft bundled its browser into its industry standard Windows operating system and gave away the browser for free$5
Microsoft saw the browser software as a direct threat to its industry dominance and pursued that market aggressively bundling its own browser with its Windows and giving it away free tactics that have been challenged by the government$5
Now in the corridors outside the antitrust trial Microsoft s lawyers maintain that Netscape has found a new partner in America Online and has no need of protection from the government$5
On Friday and Monday Lacovara repeatedly pointed out that other companies are placing other operating systems on the market and some software companies principally Microsoft s greatest rivals are writing software for these new systems$5
Still AOL and Sun have a longer term objective as well one that promises to place them in more direct conflict with Microsoft$5
Surely this combination he asked tells you something about the nature of competition in the software industry Warren Boulton s answer was probably not the one Lacovara had been after$5
That is the foundation under most of the government s case since federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior by a monopolist that would be legal for a firm that faces healthy competition$5
The Netscape transformation was largely a reaction to Microsoft s competitive assault on its browser business a central element in the government s antitrust suit against Microsoft$5
The department has presented solid evidence that Microsoft has used its monopoly in operating systems to muscle rivals and partners so as to head off competition in other software realms$5
The government alleges these steps were part of a pattern of anticompetitive practices while Microsoft maintains the moves were intended mainly to benefit consumers$5
The reasoning behind this assertion Microsoft says is that the proposed deal demonstrates that Netscape and the larger software industry are healthy and vibrant even with all of the illegal and anti competitive practices alleged in the government s suit$5
The software industry is so vibrant and fast moving he suggested that Microsoft could be toppled from its position at any moment a point of view the company encourages among its employees$5
Through repeated often circumlocutious questioning Lacovara tried to make the case that Microsoft s overwhelming market share was ephemeral$5
To the extent that this potential merger is the result of Microsoft s actions with these exclusive contracts and other actions he said it is unfortunate to see the disappearance of a firm like Netscape the brightest newest star Warren Boulton s purpose on the stand for the government is to establish that Microsoft does have a monopoly in operating system software more than percent of the world s computers use a Microsoft operating system$5
Whatever the deal ends up being if there ends up being a deal is not going to remove any of the obstacles that Microsoft has placed in the path of competition in this industry he said$5
