Robert Cabana of the Marine Corps a veteran of three space flights is to nudge the shuttle forward to join the two station pieces together$0
Robert Cabana of the Marines the shuttle commander confirmed that two antennas had failed to deploy from the module following its launch from Kazakhstan on Nov$0
Such a blind docking had never been attempted before$0
Sure it s frustrating said Bill Readdy shuttle program director and a veteran shuttle commander$0

By the time controllers traced the problem to a momentary drop in hydraulic pressure and decided to press ahead it was too late they had missed the cutoff by a second or two$18
Controllers studied the data and discovered a momentary pressure drop on one of the hydraulic systems that control the movements of the shuttle s engines and its rudder and other flight surfaces$18
Officials eventually decided that the pressure drop was insignificant and they resolved to press ahead$18
The pressure dropped just long enough to trigger the alarm evidently because of a sensitive switch then returned to normal$18
NASA engineers spent the day examining the problem but found nothing wrong with any of the systems and were confident it would not reoccur$19
Aboard Endeavour is an American made connecting passageway named Unity$2
In case Zarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot arm two spacewalking astronauts would have to manually fit them together$2

The computerized system examined markings on both modules computed their relationship to one another using the marks and displayed the results on a laptop computer$25
The conclusions were mutual Brinkley said$26
We have mutually concluded that it would not be prudent to make these changes Brinkley said during a news conference held at the Johnson Space Center in Houston$26
We want to err on the conservative side Ralph Roe launch director at the Kennedy Space Center said at a news conference after the sudden halt of the countdown just seconds before liftoff$26
A last minute alarm forced NASA to halt Thursday s launching of the space shuttle Endeavour on a mission to start assembling the international space station$27
After separating from the new outpost the crew is to bring Endeavour back to the Kennedy Space Center on Dec$27
At the same time the station s costs are rising and its critics among scientists worry that its appetite for money will consume their own federal financing$27
Both sides concluded that it did not make sense The Russians struggling to find money for their space program with their nation in economic collapse had said they wanted to transfer thousands of pounds of newer equipment and scientific instruments from Mir as an economy move$27
But by then it was too late time had run out for one of the procedures needed to keep the shuttle s fuel supercold$27
Construction of the station which will be a research facility will require an estimated space walks which for safety reasons will always be done by two people$27
Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station the Russian made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle$27

Endeavour s flight is already a year late because of a cash crunch in Russia one of NASA s partners in building the international space station$27
Following a series of intricate maneuvers and the skillful use of the space shuttle Endeavour s robot arm astronauts on Sunday joined the first two of many segments that will form the international space station$27
For the second day in a row astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour on Friday for liftoff on NASA s first space station construction flight$27
Gretchen McClain NASA s director in Washington for the international space station said in an interview here that its overall costs were actually small for individual Americans$27
However some critics questioned the Russians motives wondering if the requested orbital change was part of plan to delay the decommissioning and destruction of Mir which the Russians have agreed to do next summer$27
Moscow s economic and political woes have left Western officials unsure of its ability and willingness to come up with its share of money and technology$27
Most experts outside the agency consider this figure ridiculously low because it ignores many billions of dollars spent in early development work as well as the cost of numerous shuttle flights which run about million apiece$27
NASA has only five minutes or less each day to launch Endeavour in order to meet up with the first space station part which was put in orbit two weeks ago by the Russians$27
NASA was surprised last week when Russia s prime station contractor proposed the orbital position change just two and a half weeks before launch of the first part of the new station$27
NASA will consider ideas for salvaging Mir s research equipment to use on the international space station he said but only if it does not interfere with assembling the new station$27
Of that American taxpayers are to spend roughly billion and the project s foreign partners about billion$27
That brevity was a result of Endeavour s having to rendezvous with a space station part that Russia put into orbit last month$27
The Mir competes with the international space station for very critical resources and for funding Brinkley said$27
The Russians have so little money that the United States and other partners in the international station fear that money spent on Mir will prevent Russia from meeting its obligations with the new project$27
The United States and other nations plan to begin building the new station in orbit next week when the Russians launch a module that will supply power and propulsion during the early stages of the five year construction period$27
The one day delay cost NASA about mostly in fuel and overtime pay$27
The planet s most daring construction job began Friday as the shuttle Endeavour carried into orbit six astronauts and the first US built part of an international space station that is expected to cost more than billion$27
The project entails high risk because of the technical difficulty of putting all this together in the unforgiving environment of space along with the dangers inherent in flying the space shuttle to the construction site$27
The project s total cost is a subject of debate but the most credible estimates now put the price of assembly and of operation for a decade the station s estimated lifetime at billion$27
The shuttle contains the second station component$27
The space shuttle Endeavor is to follow on Dec$27
The spece station is expected to cost its partnership of nations more than billion just to construct$27
The work is further complicated by international politics and worries about money$27
Their series of three space walks will continue Wednesday and end Saturday Dec$27
US costs for construction she added were billion and for operations through the year were billion for a total of billion$27
WASHINGTON NASA and the Russian Space Agency have agreed to set aside a last minute Russian request to launch an international space station into an orbit closer to Mir officials announced Friday$27
While putting the new station closer to Russia s year old Mir station would make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies from the old outpost to the new one the request came too late to be acted on said Randy Brinkley NASA s space station program manager$27
After a last minute alarm on the shuttle forced a postponement early Thursday the launch went off flawlessly at Friday morning right on schedule$3
Air Force space debris trackers noted that the shuttle was to pass within miles of a spent stage of an American booster rocket launched last month$3
Although this was considered a safe distance shuttle controllers decided to widen the separation to five miles as an extra precaution$3
But NASA was confident the master alarm in Endeavour s cockpit would behave it went off with just minutes to go in the countdown Thursday forcing a delay$3
