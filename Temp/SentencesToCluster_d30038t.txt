Saying if we have to clean we will clean Juan Antonio Samaranch responded on Sunday to allegations of corruption in the Olympic bidding process by declaring that IOC members who were found to have accepted bribes from candidate cities could be expelled
It is a serious problem we have before us Samaranch president of the International Olympic Committee said in a hastily arranged news conference at a tumultuous meeting of the IOC executive board
Samaranch compared the current climate to the Soviet boycott of the Olympics in Los Angeles and the sprinter Ben Johnson s expulsion from the Olympics in Seoul South Korea
Those were difficult moments Samaranch said
Now we are facing another difficult moment but I m sure we will solve this problem Samaranch expressed surprise at allegations made by the IOC executive board member Marc Hodler of Switzerland that agents were offering to sell IOC members votes for payments from bidding cities
Hodler the second most senior member of the IOC said Saturday that he knew of four agents including one IOC member who engaged in such activities
Hodler said he believed that to percent of the IOC membership which currently numbers asked for some sort of compensation for their vote
He has called for a new electoral process in which the executive board or some other select IOC group would decide which cities become Olympic hosts instead of the full IOC membership
Samaranch agreed Sunday that the time had come to explore change
The system we have now is very complicated very slow and very expensive he said
Hodler the former head of the International Ski Federation also claimed that the Fiat tycoon Gianni Agnelli had given free vans to influence votes for the Italian resort of Sestriere to hold the world skiing championships
Fiat denied the claims on Saturday but Sunday Howard Peterson a former senior American delegate to the ski federation said he had been offered cars by two Fiat executives
The issue of vote buying came to the fore in Lausanne because of the recent disclosure of scholarship payments made to six relatives of IOC members by Salt Lake City officials during their successful bid to play host to the Winter Games
The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has said the payments which amounted to slightly less than came from a privately financed fund that was started in 
And Intermountain Health Care Utah s largest health care provider confirmed Sunday that it gave free surgical services to at least two people associated with the IOC in 
A special commission headed by the IOC vice president Dick Pound was appointed on Friday to investigate the issue and has met with Salt Lake officials
Sunday Frank Joklik president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee issued a public apology to the Olympic family and the citizens of Utah for the embarrassment caused by the scholarships program
Samaranch Sunday ruled out taking the Games from Salt Lake City
He said If necessary we will expel members if this ad hoc commission thinks these members are guilty Pound said his commission was already satisfied Salt Lake City won the Games on the merit of the bid He also said that his commission would expand its inquiry beyond the Salt Lake City bid only if it was presented with evidence and not simply rumors of corruption in other bids
On Saturday Hodler had suggested the bidding teams from Atlanta and Nagano Japan that won the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics had not run clean campaigns
Billy Payne who presided over Atlanta s bid and Makoto Kobayashi the general secretary of the Nagano organizing committee denied those claims
Asked whether he regretted his statements Sunday Hodler said Not at all and later said that the cities have been the victims and not the villains Pound said there had been concern in the IOC for some time about agents
There always have been lobbyists he said
In recent years especially with the Olympics coming up every two years there seems to be a professional class being created Hodler when pressed for further comment this afternoon at Olympic headquarters initially covered his mouth with both hands and then said Muzzle imposed by the president Hodler is one of only four IOC members with life membership because he was appointed before age limits were imposed in 
Asked if he might resign he said I m not going to resign but I might be expelled But the year old Samaranch said he had great respect for Hodler and no intention of asking for his resignation or pushing for his expulsion
LAUSANNE Switzerland AP IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch on Sunday promised to expel any members if they are found guilty of accepting bribes
Samaranch said he was surprised at the allegations of corruption in the International Olympic Committee made by senior Swiss member Marc Hodler
But he said the allegations would be considered by a special IOC panel looking into alleged rules violations by the Salt Lake group which won the Winter Games
If it is necessary we will expel members if this commission feels these members are guilty Samaranch said at a news conference
After we get the recommendations of the panel we will take the measures necessary to arrange the problem Samaranch said the IOC was intent on protecting the integrity of the organization and the Olympics as a whole
If we have to clean we will clean he said
After the IOC will be even stronger than before Samaranch said he was taken aback by Hodler s allegations which were made to reporters Saturday
Samaranch said Hodler should have brought his allegations first to the IOC executive board
For me I was really surprised
If he has names and evidence he must go to the executive board Hodler said he believed four agents including one IOC member had been involved in vote buying over the past years
He said he thought to percent of the IOC members currently numbering were open to bribery
Samaranch denied that he muzzled Hodler as the Swiss official claimed earlier Sunday
He said he had told all members of the executive board that only himself and director general Francois Carrad could speak to the media
This is not the first time I do this he said
Samaranch expressed his respect and admiration for Hodler and ruled out the possbility of expelling him from the IOC an option the Swiss member had raised
Never never is anyone thinking to expel Mr Hodler Samaranch said
The IOC also ruled out any possibility of stripping Salt Lake City of the games over alleged rules violations during the bid
No there is not any kind of possibiity he said
We trust the organizing committee of Salt Lake City The Salt Lake controvery centers on a scholarship program that provided nearly dlrs in tuition and other assistance to individuals including six relatives of IOC members mostly from Africa
Samaranch said the IOC would possibly consider a new procedure to eliminate the tempations for corruption in the selection of host cities
Under current rules all IOC members have a vote
Samaranch noted the IOC could adopt the formula used by sports federations such as FIFA world soccer s governing body which assign their executive boards to select sites
The mayor of the Japanese city of Nagano site of the Winter Olympics denied allegations that city officials bribed members of the International Olympic Committee to win the right to host the games
Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada was responding to allegations by Marc Hodler the Swiss member of the IOC executive board of systematic buying and selling of the Olympic Games
I have never heard of such a thing Tsukada told the Associated Press Sunday
As far as Nagano is concerned we haven t done anything wrong
We were selected as host of the Olympics through our efforts
We can t believe that Mr Hodler has made such a statement he said
Tsukada was vice chairman of the Japanese committee to invite the Olympics to Nagano
Nagano has been criticized for spending a large amount of money to win the games
Sports Nippon a leading Japanese sports newspaper said more than billion yen dlrs million of the money Nagano spent to bring the games there has not been accounted for
Japan Olympic Committee has warned cities seeking to host the games in the future that they should not entertain IOC members excessively the newspaper said
Holder s accusation might effect the invitation activities for the summer Olympics by Osaka Japan s second largest city the paper said
Osaka is competing with Beijing China and other cities for the right to host the games
Nagano became the first Asian city to host the Winter Games since Sapporo Japan played host to the games
Eighty eight IOC members took part in a secret vote in to decide who would host the games
Nagano led in each of the five rounds beating out Salt Lake city votes to in the final ballot
What started as a local controversy in Salt Lake City has evolved into a full blown international scandal
The International Olympic Committee has ordered a top level investigation into the payment of nearly dlrs in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake group which won the bid for the Winter Games
IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund described as humanitarian aid by Salt Lake officials amounted to a bribe I m terribly sorry that even Salt Lake City by far the best place to hold the winter games had to use certain methods in order to get the vote Hodler said
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch assigned the international body s juridical commission which deals with legal and ethical issues to investigate
The inquiry will be headed by IOC vice president Keba Mbaye of Senegal a highly respected former World Court judge
The scholarship fund was first disclosed two weeks ago by a Salt Lake radio station
The controversy is now bound to overshadow the routine progress report which the Salt Lake Olympic Committee SLOC is scheduled to make to the IOC executive board this weekend
SLOC president Frank Joklik who arrived in Lausanne Friday welcomed the IOC investigation
I think that s who the matter should be taken up by he told The Associated Press
Of course we intend to collaborate fully with the IOC and its investigation Joklik expressed concern that the case had harmed Salt Lake s image
I appreciate the perception of this matter is bad now he said
Asked about Hodler s accusation of bribery Joklik said he hadn t seen the remarks yet and couldn t reply directly
But he sought to distance himself from the allegations by making a distinction between the actions of the bidding committee and the current organizing committee
Presumably Hodler s remarks are related to actions of the bid commitee before Joklik said
The organizing committee certainly has people of integrity and ethical standards that would stand any investigation
The facts were in the early s when the bid committee was operating US Olympic Committee deputy secretary general John Krimsky described the controversy as disruptive for Salt Lake s image and preparations for the games
It doesn t do us any good at all he said
I hope we see a speedy resolution to Judge Mbaye s review
I hope it will be a footnote
I hope it never becomes a chapter Salt Lake organizers th graf pvs
Following is the text of the rules on gifts and benefits that were in force during the bidding for the Winter Olympics The finalist cities as well as third parties acting for them or on their behalf or in their favor are forbidden to give IOC members as well as their blood relations relatives by marriage guests or companions any presents liberalities or direct or indirect benefits other than souvenirs ot small presents of a total value which shall in no case exceed US dlrs per person Finalist cities and any third parties acting for them or on their behalf or in their favor are forbidden to conclude with IOC members their relations relatives by marriage their guests or companions agreements transactions or any other contracts In the event of a serious breach of the present regulations the IOC executive board may further propose to the IOC session that it exclude the city having breached the regulation from the contest for the games 
Swiss IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said Sunday he might be thrown out of the International Olympic Committee for making allegations of corruption within the Olympic movement
Asked whether he might resign Hodler said No I don t resign
But maybe I will be expelled
You never know Hodler who made the allegations Saturday said he has since been muzzled by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch
His comments came as the leader of the Salt Lake organizing committee apologized Sunday for the alleged rules violations during the city s successful bid for the Winter Games
The IOC meanwhile said it was prepared to investigate allegations made by Hodler of bribery in the selection of Olympic host cities

A top IOC official on Saturday made explosive allegations of widespread Olympic corruption saying agents demand up to dlrs million to deliver votes in the selection of host cities
Marc Hodler a senior member of the International Olympic Committee executive board alleged malpractices in the voting for the Atlanta Games Sydney Olympics and Salt Lake Games
Hodler said a group of four agents including one IOC member have been involved in promising votes for payment
He declined to identify them
The four agents try to make a living out of this he said
I missed a chance to be a rich man
Some of the agents do the following they say I can offer this or that number of votes The price wold be between dlrs and dlrs million for a number of votes a bloc Hodler added that the agents then charge the city winning the bid something like dlrs million to dlrs millon Hodler an year old Swiss lawyer said there is one agent who boasts that no city has ever won the Olympic Games without his help No one can prove that Hodler said
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated himself from Hodler s allegations
The only official spokeman for the IOC executive board is director general Francois Carrard Samaranch said
All the other comments are personal comments
They are not official comments Hodler s allegations made to a group of reporters came as the IOC continued investigations into alleged financial misconduct by the Salt Lake City group which won the bid for the games
Hodler has described as a bribe the dlrs scholarship fund set up by Salt Lake which benefited the relatives of six IOC members
It also came as the former minister in charge of Sydney s Olympic bid revealed he was asked to offer bribes in exchange for votes
Bruce Baird the former New South Wales minister said he refused
Asked whether Atlanta s victory in the vote for the games was clean Hodler said Certainly not Asked whether Sydney s election was clean he said I would be surprised
I know what happened but I don t want to disclose it I can t imagine that Sydney is different from the others he said
Sydney pretends it is completely clean clean clean Hodler contested the argument by the current Salt Lake organizing committee that it was not directly involved in the controversial scholarship program and that the onus was on former bid chief Thomas Welch
Yesterday the lawyer of Salt Lake City said Everything had been done by Tom Welch who is not there any more
We know nothing My experience is that this is not true The controversy centers on scholarships including tuition assistance and athlete training programs paid to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake bid committee
From to the committee under the direction of Welch spent nearly dlrs on scholarships to individuals six of them relatives of IOC members mostly from Africa
The current SLOC president Frank Joklik was chairman of the bid committee at the time
SLOC vice president Dave Johnson was also a high official on the bid committee
The senior Olympic official who leveled stunning allegations of corruption within the IOC said Sunday he had been muzzled by president Juan Antonio Samaranch and might be throw out of the organization

Moving quickly to tackle an escalating corruption scandal IOC leaders questioned Salt Lake City officials Friday in the first ever investigation into alleged vote buying by an Olympic city
Acting with unusual speed the International Olympic Committee set up a special investigative panel that immediately summoned the organizers of the Salt Lake Games to address the bribery allegations
The chief investigator refused to rule out the possibility of taking the games away from Salt Lake City though that scenario is considered highly unlikely
Frank Joklik president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and SLOC senior vice president Dave Johnson appeared before the IOC panel for minutes Friday night
Both sides declined to comment after the talks saying the inquiry was still in process
Earlier Joklik met with IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and other top officials to provide information and documents on the case
The controversy centers on the payment of nearly dlrs in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake bid committee which won the right to stage the games
Senior IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund described as humanitarian aid by Salt Lake officials amounted to a bribe to sway votes in the election
It s the most serious case of alleged ethical misconduct investigated by the IOC since former US member Robert Helmick was accused of conflict of interest in 
Helmick eventually resigned both as an IOC member and as president of the US Olympic Committee
This is the first time the IOC has ever investigated possible bribery by bidding cities despite previous rumors and allegations of corruption in other Olympic votes
The executive board takes this matter very seriously said Dick Pound the IOC vice president heading the Salt Lake inquiry
Despite many requests made in the past or evidence to support rumors that have been floating around we have never had anything come forward
Specific allegations have now been made
The executive board acted very quickly to investigate Also on the investigative panel are IOC vice president Keba Mbaye executive board members Jacques Rogge and Thomas Bach and IOC director general Francois Carrard
Pound said the panel would investigate allegations that there may or may not have been payments for the benefit of members of the IOC or their families connected with the Salt Lake City bid Pound a Canadian lawyer said there was no deadline for completion of the investigation but said it was possible the inquiry could be wrapped up this weekend
Pound declined to speculate on what if any sanctions could be taken against Salt Lake but did not rule out moving the games elsewhere
We re not going to make any conclusions or any speculations as to what we may decide until we know what the facts are he said
Moving the games would be unprecedented and with just over three years to go would be a logistical nightmare
Most of the facilities needed for the games in Salt Lake already are built
John Krimsky deputy secretary general of the US Olympic Committee discounted any possibility of the games being moved
There is no chance at all absolutely none in my mind he said
I can t be stronger in saying I don t consider it a possibility whatsoever of the games being withdrawn from Salt Lake City
Salt Lake organizers have denied that the bid committee s dlrs project was an effort to buy key IOC members support in the four years between votes on the and Winter Games
Salt Lake lost the race to Nagano Japan in when the program was begun
It won a landslide vote over Sion Switzerland for the Games in the balloting
From to the bid committee under the direction of former president Thomas Welch spent nearly dlrs on scholarships to individuals six of them relatives of IOC members mostly from Africa
Olympic rules prohibit bidding cities from giving IOC members or their relatives any presents or benefits exceeding a value of dlrs 
I ve already stated I do not regard what was done as a bribe Joklik said Friday
I recognize there have been perceptions contrary to that
I regret those perceptions but I don t feel they are justified Joklik was chairman of the bid committee at the time the No
official behind Welch
Welch resigned last year as president of the organizing committee after being accused of domestic violence against his wife
He currently serves as a SLOC consultant
The organizing committee certainly has people of integrity and ethical standards that would stand any investigation Joklik said
The facts were in the early s when the bid committee was operating Among those identified as receiving scholarship funds was Sonia Essomba the daughter of the late Rene Essomba of Cameroon
The elder Essomba a prominent surgeon was the secretary general of the National Olympic Committees of Africa
A top IOC official on Saturday made explosive allegations of widespread Olympic corruption saying agents demand up to dlrs million to deliver votes in the selection of host cities
Marc Hodler a senior member of the International Olympic Committee executive board alleged malpractices in the bid campaigns for the games of and 
Hodler said a group of four agents including one IOC member have been involved in promising votes for payment
He declined to identify them
The four agents try to make a living out of this he said
I missed a chance to be a rich man
Some of the agents do the following they say I can offer this or that number of votes The price would be between dlrs and dlrs million for a number of votes a bloc Hodler added that the agents then charge the city winning the bid something like dlrs million to dlrs millon Hodler an year old Swiss lawyer said there is one agent who boasts that no city has ever won the Olympic Games without his help No one can prove that Hodler said
It could be possible He said he believed agents had been buying and selling votes for the past years
There are four agents we know he said
One is an IOC member
He promises he will give enough votes so the biddding city can win Asked whether all Olympic votes are tainted Hodler said I know of so many times
There is a good chance it is always the case IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated himself from Hodler s allegations
The only official spokeman for the IOC executive board is director general Francois Carrard Samaranch said
All the other comments are personal comments
They are not official comments Hodler s allegations made to a group of reporters came as the IOC continued investigations into alleged financial misconduct by the Salt Lake City group which won the bid for the games
Hodler has described as a bribe the dlrs scholarship fund set up by Salt Lake which benefited the relatives of six IOC members
It also came as the former minister in charge of Sydney s Olympic bid revealed he was asked to offer bribes in exchange for votes
Bruce Baird the former New South Wales minister said he refused
Asked whether Atlanta s victory in the vote for the games was clean Hodler said Certainly not John Krimsky deputy secretary general of the US Olympic Committee disputed Hodler s assertion
There is no basis for the charges against Atlanta at this point Krimsky said
All these issues should be put to the IOC review commission Hodler also leveled allegations against the head of the Athens bid which lost to Atlanta in the vote
Hodler said he overheard Spyros Metaxa a wealthy Greek businessman who led the bid describing Samaranch and IOC members as stupid for imposing restrictions on the bidding process
For me there is only one purpose winning the games Hodler quoted Metaxa as saying
I will do whatever is necessary to win the games if it costs me dlrs dlrs million or dlrs million Hodler said he didn t know of any misconduct in Athens successful bid for the games
Asked whether Sydney s election for the games was clean Hodler said I would be surprised
I know what happened but I don t want to disclose it I can t imagine that Sydney is different from the others he said
Sydney pretends it is completely clean clean clean The committee which won the games for Nagano certainly had to do things which are not legitimate Hodler said
Hodler contested the argument by the current Salt Lake organizing committee that it was not directly involved in the controversial scholarship program and that the onus was on former bid chief Thomas Welch
Yesterday the lawyer of Salt Lake City said Everything had been done by Tom Welch who is not there any more

The current SLOC president Frank Joklik was chairman of the bid committee at the time
SLOC vice president Dave Johnson was also a high official on the bid committee
Hodler said the blame shud be on those who put pressure on Salt Lake to offer the scholarship funds
Nobody blames Salt Lake City he said
We blame those voters who can be bought not Salt Lake City
They were a victim
We should thank them for not paying money only scholarships Joklik on Saturday denied any payment for votes
I don t even know what agents are he said
