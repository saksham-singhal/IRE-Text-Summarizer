APEC meetings but Mahathir s treatment of Anwar and his reform movement already have been criticized by APEC members such as Australia Indonesia the Philippines and the United States$1
Ambassador Jose Brillantes said in a radio interview from Kuala Lumpur that he was called Thursday after the Malaysian dissident s eldest daughter met Philippine President Joseph Estrada$1
And even though Clinton has promised to attend the APEC meeting some people wonder how he can do that while facing an impeachment inquiry back home thanks to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal$1
Because of human rights involved and I think it is universal people should be given the chance to defend themselves Habibie was quoted as saying in the interview conducted Saturday$1
Beijing s threat to boycott APEC s annual meeting if Lee attends has forced him to send a stand in every year since the inaugural summit in $1
But we should welcome the chance to work together and to develop a sense of what s possible So far APEC has been criticized for doing little during the financial crisis$1
During the Malaysia meeting APEC also will include three new members Russia one of the latest victims of the financial crisis Vietnam and Peru$1
Estrada called Anwar his friend and said I think all of us here believe that due process and human rights should be respected Indonesian President BJ Habibie may also stay away his foreign minister Ali Alatas said after the two new Southeast Asian leaders held a half hour private meeting$1
Habibie apologized when Estrada finally arrived at the Melia Panorama Hotel$1
If Habibie passes up APEC Alatas said it will be because he has difficulty leaving the country while there is no vice president while there are so many problems to deal with Habibie has already canceled a state visit to Malaysia citing difficulties at home$1
It has set APEC back and there is no silver bullet to solve the crisis right away said Wolf$1
Meanwhile Malaysia s most prominent dissident predicted that the country s prime minister would declare a state of emergency after the APEC meeting ends in Kuala Lumpur a report said Sunday$1
On Thursday Estrada told Anwar s daughter Nurul Izzah to tell her father not to waver because he is fighting for a cause the cause of the Malaysian people He said however that his support is personal and moral and not meant to interfere in the internal problems of Malaysia$1
People should not be tortured Habibie said Anwar s dismissal should not have been based on things which had not been proven On attending the APEC meeting he said It s difficult for me But he said he would consult parliament adding I m not coming personally but as the president of million people of Indonesia Like Estrada Habibie served as his country s vice president when Anwar was deputy prime minister making them counterparts on the international affairs circuit$1
Philippine President Joseph Estrada told business and political leaders in Singapore on Tuesday that he had not made up his mind$1
President BJ Habibie of Indonesia and Philippine President Joseph Estrada consider Anwar a friend and Estrada won t say whether he plans to attend this year s APEC summit$1
Russia Vietnam and Peru will also join APEC this year$1
Russia Vietnam and Peru will join in November$1
Still the mere fact that Malaysia s experiment has yielded some positive results guarantees that the issue will come up during the APEC meeting$1
The Philippine ambassador to Malaysia said Friday he was summoned to the Malaysian Foreign Ministry to explain his president s statements in support of dissident Anwar Ibrahim$1
The meeting was delayed for almost minutes when a mechanical fault was discovered in one of two Indonesian helicopters that were to have flown Estrada and his entourage through heavy rain from Singapore$1
There is no way the likes of Clinton or Jiang Zemin are going to be able to muzzle him he added referring to President Jiang of China$1
These are not easy things to do he said$1
They could hardly be meeting in a more provocative place$1
They expressed their concern about what s happening and the statements coming out of the Philippines Brillantes told radio station DZXL in Manila$1
We still consider as expressed by our president that APEC is important to us he said$1
Wolf the US ambassador for APEC recently acknowledged that it won t be easy for APEC members to meet in Malaysia as the Asian crisis ricochets around the world with no clear sign what will happen next But he also said the leaders of the APEC members should aim for a productive meeting$1
Yusof said recent events had vindicated Malaysia s contention that it needed to insulate itself from the ravages of the global financial system$1
and resume after the APEC meetings$1
Analysts liken the situation to buying an insurance policy for a disaster that has come and gone$10
So the consumers who are buying new cars and home appliances are merely dipping into their savings which means the buying spree will end when their savings are depleted$10
The rescue of politically connected companies remains a tense issue here$11
Mahathir who had heart bypass surgery in had groomed Anwar as his successor$12
Brillantes said he explained that following the people power revolt against the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Filipinos react strongly to real and perceived violations of human rights I just explained our culture to them he said$13
He did not say how the Malaysian officials reacted but he said he was not reprimanded$13
For every comforting statistic though the critics produce an alarming one$14
The critics said Mahathir had spooked would be investors without even locking in the ones who used to be here$14
Mahathir is a very outspoken political leader said Chia Yew Boon an independent analyst in Singapore$15

It s very impressive David said adding that Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda promised Parliament would pass reform measures in months not years The US ASEAN Business Council is a private organization comprising about US companies with substantial investments in Southeast Asia$18
Mahathir s decision drew jeers from international investors and policy makers who warned that Malaysia was seeking a quick fix that would retard its desperately needed reforms and leave it the odd man out when Asia finally recovered from the regional malaise$18
Many of Asia s economies have plunged into recession since that agreement$18
Other well respected economists are going even further questioning whether a free market philosophy doesn t leave some countries too vulnerable to the chaos of major market speculators$18
Policy makers in the United States have expressed fears that if Malaysia s gambit is seen as successful other economically weakened countries in the region like Indonesia might be tempted to try it$18
So far Indonesian officials have said they would stick to the recovery plan devised by the International Monetary Fund which stresses economic austerity and open markets$18
Stanley Fischer deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund noted that some countries have already reformed their banking sectors$18

This is very aggressive good reform$18
Top finance officials from countries in the Asia Pacific region advised Asia s battered economies on Sunday to adopt further reforms in their effort to restore stability$18
We would be quick as observers to applaud the aggressiveness of the reform packages that we see being proposed in front of your government today said business council chairman George David who is also chairman and CEO of United Technologies Corp$18
What I hope they will say at APEC is a very strong affirmation of the free trade agenda and a very strong affirmation of the foreign direct investment agenda he added$18
While foreign direct investment fell in September to million from an average monthly rate of million for the period from January through September it did not dry up completely$18
Wolf said such gatherings give members a chance to discuss IMF bailout strategies and the free market philosophy to resolve bilateral disputes and to continue to reduce tariff rates to help struggling countries improve their exports$18
Worse still Asia s economic crisis is showing signs of going global and more and more economists are criticizing the IMF for the way it is handling its bailouts$18
Anwar denies the allegations and says they were fabricated because Mahathir considered his popularity a threat to the prime minister s year rule$2
Anwar s sensational trial is a reminder that Mahathir s economic policies cannot be disentangled from politics$2
Anwar was also dumped from the ruling party and after two weeks of nationwide rallies at which he called for government reform and Mahathir s resignation he was arrested under a law that allows police to hold him indefinitely and prevent him from seeing his family and lawyers$2
Anwar was arrested Sept$2
But because of the large number of candidates for the deputy s job within the ruling United Malays National Organization a decision was not expected quickly$2
But he fired his protege from his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister on grounds he was morally unfit to lead$2
But he was suddenly fired by Mahathir on Sept$2
But officials in Japan have expressed some sympathy for Mahathir s policies while Paul Krugman an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has advocated using them as an emergency measure$2
But that s not happening The biggest flaw in Malaysia s policy Jomo and others said is its timing$2
Canada the host country was criticized by some in Canada for cracking down on demonstrations against Suharto Indonesia s iron fisted ruler at the time$2
During boom times Mahathir won support for his policies by wrapping them in anti foreigner language$2
He then began speaking out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept$2
I m concerned because people should not forget that Anwar Ibrahim had contributed a lot for the benefit of his country Anwar is a charismatic politician who was once picked to be the successor to Malaysia s long serving Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad$2
In doing so the Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad in effect slammed the door on the global economy that President Clinton and the other leaders are coming here to champion$2
Instead of stepping aside Anwar launched a reform movement across Malaysia that quickly led to big rallies demanding that Mahathir step down$2
Ironically Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad who made one of his typical anti free market comments during last year s summit probably could have opened this year s with an I told you so But even he is having major domestic problems$2
It s expected to be a hot affair$2
Japan the world s second largest economy and Asia s financial anchor is suffering through its worst recession since World War II and that bad news cost Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto his job$2
Mahathir who is widely credited with creating modern Malaysia during his years in power dismissed Anwar Ibrahim his expected successor in an apparent dispute over how to battle the country s economic mess$2
On Sept$2
Other top contenders included Mahathir s confidant Daim Zainuddin a former finance minister brought back into the Cabinet in June as special functions minister in charge of economic recovery$2
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar in September saying he was morally unfit to lead then had him expelled from Malaysia s ruling party$2
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said last week he could drop dead at any time$2
Rafidah Aziz the international trade and industry minister and Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah a former finance minister were also in the running$2
Suharto who ruled Indonesia for years was driven out of power by a violent pro democracy movement and the world s fourth most populous country is in real trouble financially$2
The Star newspaper which is close to the government listed the favorites as Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Education Minister Najib Tun Razak$2
The UMNO supreme council was expected to prepare a list of top candidates for Anwar s job for Mahathir s final decision$2
The former deputy prime minister and finance minister of Malaysia was arrested Sept$2
The government s rescue of Renong a major conglomerate with close ties to Mahathir is going ahead though some analysts predict the government will eventually scrap the much criticized plan$2
The party leaders who have been conducting a national campaign to explain to Malaysians why the popular Anwar was fired Sept$2
The ruling coalition had scheduled a giant rally in the capital Saturday aimed at drawing in the youth to whom Anwar s campaign of reform has the most appeal$2
The two had differed over economic policy and Anwar has said Mahathir feared he was a threat to his year rule$2
They decided that the government should be brought down through demonstrations riots the Bernama news agency quoted Mahathir as saying in Sarawak state on Borneo Island$2
They precipitated the current recession in every country But Mahathir s treatment of Anwar has stirred anger and sparked growing social unrest in Malaysia$2
With Mahathir leading the campaign the cause of capital controls will have a fiery advocate who has a penchant for getting under the skin of Westerners$2
after giving much thought to an invitation from Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad the ministry said$2
after the two differed on economic policy$2
Among the necessary steps is for countries to restructure their economies and corporations to make them less susceptible to abuse by narrow political interests the officials suggested$3
Because the country is sheltered from the vagaries of capital flows and currency fluctuations they said the government had been able to ease interest rates and encourage consumer spending$3
But he stressed the need for corporate restructuring as well$3
But we want to see whether this is strongly sustainable Critics said it was predictable that capital controls would be a short term tonic to Malaysia s economy$3
Foreign investors have also not wholly abandoned Malaysia as experts had predicted they would$3
Habibie took office May hours after his predecessor and mentor Suharto was forced from power after national protests and street riots over Indonesia s collapsing economy$3
He said the recent near collapse of a prominent American hedge fund underscored how sudden flows of capital can have destructive consequences$3
In a speech on Monday he attacked a familiar target saying foreign currency traders are the cause of the currency turmoil adding They spread it worldwide$3
In addition to growing foreign reserves he said Malaysia had improved its trade balance and revived consumer purchases of durable goods$3
In fact Malaysia isn t the only country trying self defense mechanisms such as capital controls$3
In fact other Asian currencies like the Indonesian rupiah and the Thai baht have actually rebounded since Malaysia suspended trading in its currency and fixed the exchange rate at ringgit to the dollar$3
It s nice to be able to say that since we adopted capital controls the economy has improved said Zainal Aznam Yusof the deputy director of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies a research organization here that helped draft the policies$3
Malaysia discontinued trading in its currency the ringgit and imposed sweeping controls on the flow of capital in its stock and currency markets particularly on investment from overseas$3
Malaysia s foreign reserves rose strongly in September and there is anecdotal evidence that consumers are starting to spend again$3
Malaysia s year old prime minister clashed with his former protege over how to respond to the Asian crisis and he dismissed Anwar the day after imposing capital controls$3
More important the capital controls are slowing down much needed corporate and banking reforms$3
Now though Mahathir s allies are marshaling new economic data that they say indicate that capital controls are breathing new life into the country s moribund economy$3
The LTCM fiasco really provides a case study of what could go wrong in the global economy Yusof said$3
The Long Term Capital Management hedge fund based in Greenwich Conn was nearly wrecked by a series of wrong bets on Treasury securities after the collapse of the economy in Russia prompted a flight of capital out of that country$3
The argument was that by imposing capital controls you d regain control over monetary policy which would increase the supply of money and lessen the liquidity crunch said KS Jomo a professor of political economy at the University of Malaya here$3
There is a case to be made for the temporary imposition of capital controls but to avert a crisis not to respond to one Jomo said$3
They said the increase in Malaysia s foreign reserves was merely due to the new capital restrictions which stipulated that Malaysian currency held outside the country would be worthless unless repatriated by Sept$3
Things will heat up if the economy does not improve said Chandra Muzaffar a professor of political science at the University of Malaya$3
With capital controls as protection Yusof said Malaysia was picking up the pieces of its shattered economy$3
With protesters chanting for reform on the usually orderly streets of this city experts said Mahathir needed capital controls to work in order to soothe the country s agitated population$3
With the Asian crisis more than a year old much of the foreign capital that was in the country has already gone$3

The United States would downgrade President Bill Clinton s visit to Kuala Lumpur next month if Anwar continued to be mistreated the Wall Street Journal quoted an official in Washington as saying$4
The agenda might be global but the menu will be Malaysian when world leaders meet next week for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum$4
The delegation will travel to Kuala Lumpur for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum Nov$4
The worsening financial gloom is likely to dominate talks at next week s summit in Kuala Lumpur of leaders from the nation Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum$4
Then the whole question of Mahathir and his leadership will remain an issue In that regard at least the leaders who converge on Kuala Lumpur in two weeks will be able to identify with their embattled host$4

It has affected all of us$6
