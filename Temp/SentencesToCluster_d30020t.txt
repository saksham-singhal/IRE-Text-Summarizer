Saudi Arabia s abrupt withdrawal from the Asian Games left organizers scrambling Thursday to change schedules and Thai diplomats mulling a decade of relations strained by jewel theft and the murder of diplomats
Bhichai Rattakul deputy prime minister and president of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee asked the Foreign Ministry to urge the Saudi government to reconsider withdrawing its strong team
The games open Dec
We re not sure if this is related to the Saudi jewel scandal Bhichai told Thai radio
But regardless we should not mix sports with politics In a letter to the Thai prime minister s office reported Thursday by Bangkok newspapers Saudi sports authorities cited the looming Muslim holy month of Ramadan and national centenary celebrations as reasons for suddenly pulling out
But suspicion immediately arose that the real reason was the continued strain in relations since a Thai janitor stole precious jewelry from the palace of a Saudi prince in and fled home
Thai police recovered the jewels and returned them but many were fakes leading the Saudis to conclude that corrupt officers and members of Thailand s power elite kept the loot
The real jewels have never been recovered
Tensions were aggravated in and when three Saudi diplomats were murdered in Bangkok
In retaliation the Saudis barred new Thai guest workers and refused to renew the visas of the thousands already in the desert kingdom
The killings remain unsolved
Saudi Arabia has said relations would be normalized only when the two cases were solved
Kobsak Chutikul a Foreign Ministry spokesman said it would be understandable if Saudi Arabia pulls out because of Ramadan fasting
If there is any other reason behind this such as the jewelry case and the murders we will regret it very much because sports should be separated from politics Kobsak said
Organizers noted that other Muslim nations are sending teams
Suggestions were made that in the future the Olympic Council of Asia should consider punishing last minute withdrawals
Organizers need to hold new draws for both handball and basketball because of the pullout but said the live television coverage schedule will not be affected
The withdrawal is expected to cost million baht dlrs to cover the committee s expenses for organizing programs accommodation and television schedules
They said they would consult with the council which oversees the organization of the games about the impact of the Saudi withdrawal
Officials meanwhile expressed shock over a brawl that erupted Tuesday during a friendly soccer match between Thailand and Qatar
The scoreless match was suspended without further play after players from both sides kicked punched and body slammed each other for about minutes
Several suffered light injuries
As a host surely the melee will have an impact on the image and reputation of Thailand said Santiparb Tejavanija chairman of the administrative committee
Nobody wanted that incident to happen Officials said that forgiveness was a better option than punishment and that both sides would be admonished not to let a repeat brawl occur
For some teams out of bounds at the Asian Games means more than just a line on a soccer field or basketball floor
That s because the host city offers the punchy mix of Viagra and notorious night life
The Pakistanis say all their athletes and officials for the games opening Sunday have been told not to even think of the wonder drug and night life ideas The Indian team s solution is mandatory meetings for all athletes before bedtime
The Sri Lankan participants who had to sign a code of conduct before coming to Bangkok are being watched by an army brigadier with a track record of high discipline
The Chinese have done their homework on staying out of trouble
Thailand especially the capital Bangkok is known worldwide for its titillating night life
From taxi drivers to local tourist magazines distributed free at hotels there are messengers aplenty to advertise massage parlors and escort services
Minutely detailed photo albums seek to arouse sensual fantasies
Estimates of the number of female sex workers in Thailand a country of million range from more than to million
Under Thailand s drug rules Viagra is not available in drug stores but is sold only in hospital pharmacies with a prescription from a urologist cardiologist endocrinologist or psychiatrist for baht about dlrs a dose
But there is a black market in the drug that might prove an attraction for some among the more than athletes officials and media personnel in Bangkok
No way said Gurdayal Singh Mander leader of the Indian contingent when asked if there was a risk of lack in discipline
I believe no one will try anything silly in Bangkok
Even if they try our watching system is watertight and we will know said Mander a former police officer
Indian officials in charge of various sports meet their athletes at pm before bedtime at the Asian Games village
The Pakistanis have opted for trust and nationalism
Oh Viagra exclaimed Pakistani medical officer Yousef Baig
They know all about it and they know all about Bangkok
We have told them don t break our trust and keep the good name of Pakistan flying high Dr Baig said
China has taken a similar approach
We don t treat them as kids telling them don t do this don t do that
We just told them to leave a good impression of Chinese athletes said Li Furong deputy head of the Chinese delegation
For the Sri Lankans we have told them that they will not be allowed outside the games village until they finish their discipline said Upali Bandaratillaka a serving brigadier in the Sri Lankan army
Even if they want to go to shopping one of us will accompany them Bandaratillaka said
His deputy is a police officer
Host Thailand is stressing that sex isn t lurking around every corner
A Traditional Thai Massage Parlor has been opened at the games village
Thai traditional massage is considered an art form said Prarop Laovanich secretary of the Asian Games Sub Committee for Culture and Performance
A skilled masseur can cure ailments and muscular fatigue And one must wear baggy white pajamas before a traditional Thai massage
Thailand showed its nearly complete facilities for the Asian Games to a tough jury Thursday the heads of the organizing committees from the nations competing in the December event
Thailand won host rights for the quadrennial games in but setbacks in preparations led officials of the Olympic Council of Asia late last year to threaten to move the games to another country
They complained that the Thai organizers were behind in constructing facilities and had failed to keep them informed
It appeared that Thursday s tour was successful in reassuring everyone
We have a strong of sense of relief said Abdul Muttaleb al Ahmad director general of the Kuwait based Olympic Council of Asia and a frequent critic of Thailand s organizing committee
Everything is percent completed In a welcoming speech Thai Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul also chairman of the Thai organizing committee told delegation members to cast aside any doubts over whether the Dec
games will be a success
I can hereby confirm that regardless of what Thailand has faced we have tried to accommodate all requests for the th Asian Games said Bhichai
Since the Thai organizers began their preparations they have faced many difficulties most of them resulting from the country s financial crisis he said
But the country was able to pull it through he added
This is an example of Asia s resiliency
We have financial problems in all of Asia but still we are able to prepare commendably said Manuel Veguillas head of the Philippine delegation
I am impressed said Tu Mingde secretary general of China s Olympic Committee
The games will be a success Still Bangkok s infamous traffic jams did not go overlooked
My only concern now is the road construction leading to the site said Kenji Ono from Japan
Construction workers are trying to ensure that the road leading to the stadium including a flyover at a key intersection will be completed on time for the games
The Olympic Council of Asia meanwhile is working with the Bangkok Organizing Committee to come up with a contingency plan in case of any possible emergency said its director general Muttaleb
You cannot really anticipate anything he said as he toured the main stadium of the Sports Authority of Thailand
Any venue can have a problem such as electrical failure 
A snooker game between longtime Asian rivals India and Pakistan led to a flareup of tempers Sunday showing a depth of differences that shocked Thai organizers and spectators at the Asian Games
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since becoming independent in 
A Thai referee s decision that India s Yashin Merchant had committed a foul during a decisive frame sparked a fierce debate with the referee that forced stoppage of play for minutes
Merchant defeated Mohammad Saleh after order was restored but the incident not only violated the sport s strict etiquette but showed the distrust between the two neighbors that often has spilled over into sports
The referee ruled that Merchant s white cue ball had first touched the black before hitting the target red
Merchant protested
With the referee refusing to reverse his decision Merchant sought help from the Indian team
Several Indian team members went to the playing arena and one of them wrote a quick protest letter using the snooker table as a writing platform
Disgusted spectators viewed it as a breach of snooker etiquette
It does not look nice for grownup men wearing neckties to fight said Pakistani team manager Shahnawaz Khan
We just watched the whole drama he said
Pakistani team officials did not intervene instead staying in their allocated seats
It was made very clear to everybody that a referee s decision will be final but now that the Indians have lodged a formal complaint we have also done so Khan said
The Indian complaint however has no meaning now as Merchant has won
Indian officials were not available for comment
Tournament director Surasak Werapong said both complaints were thrown out because neither side paid the required dlrs filing fee
The match was one of the first as snooker made its Asian Games debut in style with elated officials greeting the opening with muffled clapping in keeping with the sport s etiquette
A total of countries are vying for gold medals in snooker and billiards
The preliminary elimination rounds began Sunday
This is the brightest day for us said Manmohanjit Singh the Singapore born president of the International Billiards and Snooker Federation the sport s world governing body

The three horses originally came from Iran but arrived in Thailand after a training period in the United States
They did not have the necessary health certificates guaranteeing that they are disease free said Siraya Chunekamrai president of the Veterinary Commission for the games

If the Iranian team can borrow a couple of more horses from other participating countries they still can compete she said
There are horses and countries participating in the equestrian events
Most of the horses actually come from Europe and the United States
Thailand has provided a climate controlled stable and field cleared of contaminants to help the horses become acclimatized to the tropical heat before the competition begins Dec
Many of the horses are suffering stress from the journey here but those from Asian countries are adjusting faster than those from cold countries Siraya said

The Sri Lankan team was led by six dancers in bright costumes who delighted the crowd in the seat stadium with acrobatic maneuvers
Each team was led by a Thai beauty queen holding its signboard
After the parade five of the women collapsed and three were taken out on stretchers
A giant cauldron atop the stadium was lit by touching a torch to a smaller cauldron inside a model of a temple which then was lifted on an elevator and sent an explosion of sparks into the games flame receptacle

Parts of the ceremony were built around the Indian Ramayana epic the basis for much of traditional Thai mythology literature and performing and fine arts
The field became a swirl of giant snakes swans birds angels and other mystical creatures
Another performance celebrating the unity of Asia capped the show with four large swan floats pulled to the middle of the field each tethered to a giant balloon symbolizing the sun moon earth and a giant lotus

Saudi sports authorities said the Games conflicted with national centenary celebrations and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan
But observers point rather to Saudi anger at the failure of Thai authorities to solve two decade old criminal cases involving their nationals the theft of dlrs million worth of jewels from a Saudi prince and the murder of three Saudi diplomats in Bangkok
The cases are widely believed to involve people high up in the power hierarchy who in Thailand rarely face prosecution
Saudi Arabia has in the past said relations would only be normalized when the two cases were solved
