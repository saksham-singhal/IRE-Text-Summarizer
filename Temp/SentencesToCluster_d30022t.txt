In response to criticism from home and abroad Chinese officials broke their silence Wednesday to defend their arrest this week of a prominent dissident who was trying to form an opposition political party
Xu Wenli is suspected of involvement in activities damaging to national security and has violated relevant criminal codes of the People s Republic of China said a statement from the Foreign Ministry which on Tuesday declined to comment on the arrest
The sudden arrest on Monday night of Xu as well as several other activists involved with him in trying to form the China Democratic Party set off strong protests from human rights groups other Chinese dissidents and Washington
We view his detention for peacefully exercising fundamental freedoms guaranteed by international human rights instruments as a serious step in the wrong direction State Department spokesman James P
Rubin said in Washington on Tuesday
US officials in Beijing urged the government to release Xu and asked for clarification as to the exact nature of his crime
China signed the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights with great fanfare in October and Xu s arrest is seen by human rights groups as a test of the nation s commitment to its tenets
Dissidents in and out of China rose to Xu s defense with more than a dozen activists around the country announcing that they would begin fasts in support of Xu and another leader of the China Democratic Party Qin Yongmin who was arrested in his home in Wuhan on Monday
Almost dissidents signed a letter to the Chinese government protesting the detentions said the Information Center for Human Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong Kong
Three other Democratic Party organizers were also detained on Monday although two of them were released early Wednesday
But the two more prominent dissidents Xu and Qin are likely to face a much longer haul since both have been charged with criminal acts Xu s wife He Xintong said Wednesday night that she had still not been informed of the specific charge against her husband although she surmised from the aggressive behavior of the arresting officers that the sentence could be long Qin s family was told that he was charged with plotting to subvert the government a crime that for serious offenses commands sentences of three years to life
In the Chinese criminal code this charge comes under a grab bag section called threatening state security which makes almost any political activity that questions or hampers the authority of the Communist Party illegal from violent or nonviolent activities aimed at overthrowing the government authorities to activities designed to change the basic nature of the state Xu s and Qin s trouble almost certainly stems from their efforts to gain recognition for the China Democratic Party a loose network of pro democracy activists in more than a dozen cities around China that was formed this year
In the last six months they have become increasingly aggressive and defiant in their attempts to register the party with the government submitting repeated applications even after local authorities had declared the concept of an opposition party illegal
They say the Chinese Constitution does not specifically forbid the formation of new political parties although there have been no new parties since the founding of the People s Republic in 
In fact the by laws of the China Democratic Party are fairly tame they carefully acknowledge the central role of the Communist Party but also support free speech and free elections for public officials
My husband thought the time was right to begin working to form a new party since China recently signed the covenant on human rights Ms He said
In September a few Democratic Party members got some slightly encouraging signals from local governments which initially accepted their applications to form a social organization to develop a party
But in recent weeks as organizers like Xu became more insistent and defiant harassment by the police increased
All this past week we felt something was going to happen Ms He said
It seemed that anyone who came to visit us was later detained for a while
And there have been a lot more cars from the Public Security Bureau parked outside than is usual 
Hours before China was expected to sign a key UN human rights treaty and host British Prime Minister Tony Blair police hauled a prominent human rights campaigner in for questioning Monday
Qin Yongmin s latest run in with the authorities came as he tried for the second time in a week to legally register a human rights monitoring group
Qin said a civil affairs official in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan accused him of engaging in illegal activities
The police came soon after he returned home
As I m sending this statement the Wuhan Public Security Bureau is again taking me away Qin said in a hastily scrawled message on the bottom of the typed statement faxed to reporters
Qin detained briefly two weeks ago was questioned for about three hours before being released and threatened with prosecution if he persisted in trying to set up his China Human Rights Observer
Qin hoped the harassment would stop after China signs the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights but he said if local authorities don t observe the treaty we will unswervingly push ahead with protecting human rights to the last China plans to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on Monday at the United Nations
By the time the ink is dry Blair should be landing in Beijing on Tuesday morning for the first visit by a British prime minister in seven years
The treaty is supposed to guarantee freedoms of speech and assembly
But even after China signs the treaty would not come into force until ratified by the legislature which may attach reservations effectively nullifying some provisions
Blair has vowed to discuss differences over human rights with Chinese leaders
His visit has drawn appeals from dissidents and an international press freedom group urging him to persuade Chinese leaders to free political prisoners
In an open letter three dissident said that while Chinese leaders say they respect human rights principles in law and practice the government allows rights abuses and persecution of dissidents
Thousands of political prisoners are believed to remain in Chinese prisons labor camps or detention centers said the letter a copy of which was released by the Hong Kong based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
The letter called for the release of Shi Binhai a journalist who compiled a popular book on political change Fang Jue a businessman who called openly for political reform and other imprisoned activists
Paris based Reporters Without Borders urged Blair to call for the release of Gao Yu Liu Xiaobo and Liu Jingsheng
The three are among journalists imprisoned simply for attempting to practice their profession it said in a statement
China s government said Thursday that two prominent dissidents arrested this week are suspected of endangering national security the clearest sign yet Chinese leaders plan to quash a would be opposition party
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao refused to specify what laws were broken or how Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin endangered the state
A third leading advocate of the China Democracy Party who has been in custody for a month Wang Youcai was accused of inciting the overthrow of the government the Hong Kong based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported
All three men could face up to life in prison if convicted of the harshest measures under China s vague state security law
The ruling Communist Party has resorted to the law to silence dissent since it went into effect last year
The arrests of Xu and Qin at their homes Monday night and the accusations against them and Wang were the sharpest action Chinese leaders have taken since dissidents began pushing to set up and legally register the China Democracy Party in June
Xu and Qin were suspected of involvement in activities endangering state security and their behavior breached relevant provisions of the criminal laws of the People s Republic of China Zhu said at a twice weekly briefing
Police in Hangzhou city notified Wang s wife Wednesday that charges have already been submitted to prosecutors bringing him a step closer to trial the Information Center said
Xu and Qin are influential figures in the dissident community having started their campaign for change years ago in the seminal Democracy Wall movement
Wang was a student leader in the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations
Both have served time in prison
Xu spent years in jail much of it in solitary confinement
Since dissidents began organizing and trying to legally register the China Democracy Party police have harassed and briefly detained more than two dozen members but until now the government had not leveled such politically charged allegations
The Communist Party has never allowed another political party to form since it took power in 
In Washington on Wednesday White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the United States deplored the arrests and said the dissidents peaceful political activities were fundamental human rights that all governments should protect
US officials conveyed their concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urged that Xu and Qin be released immediately
Zhu criticized the United States for condemning the arrests saying that no country including the United States should interfere in China s internal affairs China in October signed a key UN treaty on civil and political rights that guarantees freedom of expression and freedom of association
It was the th international human rights treaty China has signed
Zhu told reporters there was absolutely no contradiction at all between China s support for these treaties and its arrests of the two dissidents
Police detained and questioned the organizer of a group set up by dissidents to monitor official corruption and told him the group s activities must cease a human rights group said Thursday
Police in Xinyang in central China s Henan province took An Jun away Wednesday afternoon and held him until past midnight for questioning about the group s members said the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
Police wanted a list of members with their work and home addresses a demand An Jun refused for fear of getting them into trouble the Hong Kong based Information Center said
Corruption Watch founded by nine dissidents in seven provinces now has nearly members the center said
It applied last month to the government to register officially but received no response the center added
The police officers who questioned An Jun said that without official permission the group must cease its activities the center said
Rampant official corruption is a major public gripe in China
The Information Center said Corruption Watch had already received reports of graft in its first month of operation
In a separate report the center said that an official in the Sichuan provincial government refused Thursday to accept an application by three dissidents to form a branch of a would be opposition group the China Democracy Party
Groups of dissidents in cities across China have attempted to register the group as required by law but authorities have rejected those applications
Signaling that the Communist Party s year old ban on opposition groups remains intact police have detained and questioned many dissidents associated with the group
China s central government ordered the arrest of a prominent democracy campaigner and may use his contacts with exiled Chinese dissidents to charge him with harming national security a colleague said Wednesday
Two Beijing police officers spent minutes telling Zha Jianguo to stop trying to set up a political opposition party
Underscoring the warning they said his colleague Xu Wenli won t be released soon and may be charged for having links to reactionary groups Zha said
Xu and another influential dissident Qin Yongmin were arrested Monday night in police raids in two cities that delivered the sternest blow so far to a five month campaign to establish the China Democracy Party and challenge the ruling Communist Party s monopoly on power
Qin was arrested for plotting to overthrow the government a crime that could land him in jail for life
A third Democracy Party advocate Wang Youcai already in custody for a month was also formally arrested Monday although his family has not been informed of the charges
Zha who helped Xu organize would be party members in Beijing and the nearby port of Tianjin said police officers told him Xu s arrest was ordered by the central government not Beijing police
He took the police reference to reactionary groups to mean exiled dissidents in the United States
Under China s vague State Security Law such links may also be punishable by up to life in prison
Zha pledged to work with dissidents in China and exiles in the United States to campaign to save Xu Wenli On Wednesday dissidents from around the country demanded in an open letter that the government release Xu Qin and Wang Youcai saying the arrests run counter to UN human rights treaties China has signed over the past months
The authorities are deceiving and cheating international public opinion while on the other hand they are suppressing and persecuting domestic political dissidents said the letter faxed to foreign news agencies
In Washington White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the United States deplored the detention and arrests of Xu and Qin
We believe the peaceful political activities of this kind and other forms of peaceful expression that they ve been involved in are fundamental human rights that should be protected by all governments Lockart said
We call on the Chinese government to assure the protection in these cases of Mr Xu and Mr Qin State Department spokesman James P
Rubin said US officials conveyed their concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urged that Xu be released immediately
US officials received confirmation Wednesday that Xu is being detained on suspicion of having conducted activities damaging to China s national security Rubin said
He said he had no information from Chinese authorities about Qin or Wang
Two other democracy party supporters taken into custody in central Wuhan city along with Qin Chen Zhonghe and Xiao Shichang were released Wednesday morning said He Xintong Xu Wenli s wife
She added that police questioned the pair about the party as well as Qin s human rights monitoring organizations
Qin and Xu are towering figures in China s persecuted dissident community
Their activism dates to the seminal Democracy Wall movement of the s
Wang was a student leader in s influential Tiananmen Square democracy movement
All have spent time in prison Xu for years much of it in solitary confinement
Xu s wife said she does not know where he is being held and in her year experience with the authorities believes they are unlikely to tell her
Released in Xu picked up his campaigning for political change soon after his parole ended last year
He has tried to use China s nascent legal system and the international treaties it signed to push for reform
My husband is innocent and there s nothing he can be criticized for said his wife He Xintong
They re going to have to expend a lot of effort to make him a criminal 
The separate trials of two prominent democracy advocates for inciting subversion of the state opened Thursday morning with the families of both defendants protesting their inability to hire defense lawyers
The trial in the eastern city of Hangzhou of Wang Youcai founder of the China Democracy Party which is now suppressed was in session for just two hours and minutes
It appears to be finished although the court did not announce a decision or say when it would
I don t know what happens from here said Wang s wife Hu Jiangxia who was one of three relatives allowed to attend the trial
I don t hold much hope she added in a telephone interview
Wang who spent two years in prison after the student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square was accused of organizing a political party that sought to overturn Communist Party rule and of colluding with foreign enemies of the state
He could face five years or more in prison
Since all the lawyers his family approached were intimidated by security agents Ms Hu said Wang tried to mount his own defense Thursday morning after prosecutors laid out their case
But the judge frequently interrupted him and cut him off after half an hour saying he was not responding to the specific facts of the case she added
Wang argued that his activities were legal under China s constitution and under an international covenant on political rights that China has signed Ms Hu said
In the central city of Wuhan the trial on similar charges of Qin Yongmin a veteran dissident also continued for something over two hours
It will apparently be continued said Qin s father Qin Qingguo since the session ended after the prosecution presented its charges
In that case too prospective lawyers had been intimidated or detained family members said
The elderly father s request to the court Thursday morning for a postponement was ignored so he and one of the defendant s brothers stayed outside the court building in protest leaving another brother inside
We didn t feel there was any reason to observe the trial because if Qin Yongmin did not have a defense attorney then as far as we were concerned the proceedings were meaningless the father said by telephone
The US Embassy asked to observe the trials
When an embassy official arrived at the court in Hangzhou Thursday morning he was told that there were no seats available and instead waited outside greeting Ms Hu when she emerged shaken from the brief trial
A Chinese dissident fleeing a new round of arrests of democracy activists in Shanghai arrived here Wednesday and announced that he and other opponents of the Chinese government plan a demonstration Thursday at the United Nations to protest the crackdown
The dissident Yao Zhenxian who was released in April from a Chinese labor camp is a leader of the China Democracy Party which was formed in June during President Clinton s visit to China
Speaking through an interpreter at Kennedy International Airport Yao said little about why he had left Shanghai except that he and his younger brother Yao Zhenxiang had been sent to a labor camp in on a trumped up charge of publishing pornography
The younger Yao who is also a prominent figure in the China Democracy Party is scheduled for release in April
Last week the Chinese government arrested members and sympathizers of the China Democracy Party one of whom Wang Youcai is to go on trial Dec
The Chinese government feels it expanded too quickly Yao said at the airport referring to his party
Washington gave Yao a special visa which expires in February
Dr Wang Bingzhang an adviser to the overseas committee of the party said later that Yao had left China for personal and political reasons
They were scared all the time he said referring to Yao s wife Yu Yingzhang and daughter Yao Yiting who accompanied him
The family had a terrible life especially the daughter
Secret agents followed them all the time The family trading business which was years old was shuttered by the government in said Wang a former surgeon in Beijing so they had no way of living In addition after Yao made organizational trips to several provinces democracy activists urged him to go abroad Wang said
They wanted him to tell the truth about what is really happening in China and to call on the whole world to pay attention Wang said
Beatrice Laroche liaison at the United Nations for Human Rights in China a New York based group said the China Democracy Party was a growing presence in some of China s most populous provinces including Sichuan
But their most vocal leaders have all recently been detained she added
Ms Laroche said the Yao brothers especially the younger man won prominence by helping to finance predecessors of the China Democracy Party with money from the family business before it was closed by the government
With attorneys locked up harassed or plain scared two prominent dissidents will defend themselves against charges of subversion Thursday in China s highest profile dissident trials in two years
Qin Yongmin s and Wang Youcai s families were running out of options Wednesday to help the pair leading organizers of a budding opposition political party
Qin s family pleaded for a postponement at Wuhan s Intermediate People s Court but court officials denied the request
Police have detained one lawyer and threatened another and subtler pressures have been used on others family members said
Given the interference Wang Youcai s wife assumes he will be convicted
Whether he has a lawyer or not whatever he says the government has already decided Hu Jiangxia said
Qin and Wang will be tried separately in cities kilometers miles apart and in proceedings attended only by family and a few observers selected by the courts
Qin and Wang are accused of inciting the subversion of state power apparently for helping to organize the China Democracy Party
They face from years to life imprisonment if convicted under the harshest aspects of the law
By moving against Qin Wang and the China Democracy Party the ruling Communist Party appears to be signaling its determination to crush challenges to its monopoly on power
Authorities have detained or questioned more than people associated with the party in a day old crackdown
Qin a democracy campaigner for years and Wang a student leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy movement are among the most active and influential members of China s dissident community
A third prominent member of the dissident community Xu Wenli was also arrested in the crackdown but not yet charged
To prevent displays of solidarity outside Wang s trial police have detained at least ten dissidents in the eastern city of Hangzhou a Hong Kong based rights group reported
The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said many more are missing and believed to be in custody
To prosecute Wang authorities violated the minimal rights guaranteed suspects under Chinese law and ignored court orders his wife said
Even the judge asked me to hire a lawyer but while I was doing this some people were doing things to stop me Hu Jiangxia said
During one meeting with a potential defense attorney a police official stormed in and said Don t do anything for them
Don t take this case
Whoever takes the case you can t win Hu recounted
Four law firms refused to take Qin s case his brother Qin Xiaoguang said
The Information Center said one lawyer who initially agreed to represent Qin on Monday went missing for four hours and then called Qin s family to withdraw
Dispirited by the harsh treatment Qin s family argued over whether to attend the trial
Qin Xiaoguang said he and his father have decided to stay away to protest the unfairness but another brother will go
Three dissidents from northeastern China sent an open letter to China s legislature and the Supreme People s Court appealing for fair trials the Information Center said
It added that authorities violated China s own laws by not ensuring Wang and Qin have adequate representation
The letter was the latest in a string of petitions demonstrating the appeal of both Wang and Qin and the idea of the China Democracy Party
Since Wang publicly announced in June that he and others in Hangzhou were setting up the party dissidents in at least provinces and cities have set up party branches
Authorities have refused their applications to register the party as required by law
Wang and Qin are the most well known dissidents China has put on trial since Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan in 
He was convicted of subversion and served less than two of an year sentence
In return for his release he agreed to go into exile
One leader of a suppressed new political party will be tried on Dec
on a charge of colluding with foreign enemies of China to incite the subversion of state power according to court documents given to his wife on Monday
The decision to try the leader Wang Youcai a founder of the China Democracy Party with unusual speed suggests how serious the Communist authorities are in their campaign to destroy the fledgling party and silence dissidents who had begun to speak out over the last year
The charges that Wang faces in a trial that will almost certainly be secret and quick could bring a sentence of five years or more
Wang has been imprisoned in his home city Hangzhou in eastern China for a month but was not formally arrested until Nov
On that day two prominent dissidents both promoters of the new party were detained
One Qin Yongmin of the central city of Wuhan and the other Xu Wenli of Beijing are being held on suspicion of subversive activities
Detailed charges have not been filed
Wang was a student leader in the pro democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 
After the army had crushed the movement Wang was arrested and served two years in prison
Qin and Xu became known as democracy advocates in the late s
Qin was imprisoned for eight years
In he was put in a labor camp for two years
Xu spent years in prison
When President Clinton visited in the spring Wang announced the formation of the Democracy Party
He and other dissidents hoped that China s new friendship with the United States and its decision to sign a global covenant on political and civil rights would give them room to promote political alternatives
After Clinton returned home Wang was detained warned and released only to be re arrested as authorities began what now appears to be a major crackdown on dissent
Monday Wang s wife Hu Jiangxia was handed the bill of prosecution according to the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong Kong
Wang is charged with helping draft a party manifesto that states in part Only by establishing an opposition party can we be rid of this despotism That is cited as grounds for the subversion charge the information center said
In addition to detailing Wang s organizing activities the prosecutors charge that he colluded with enemies of the state abroad making his crime far more serious under Chinese law
He used e mail to send copies of the party s founding documents abroad met with a member of a subversive foreign organization and received money from foreign sources to buy a computer the indictment reportedly says
Protesting the lack of a defense lawyer the father of a prominent dissident is to seek a delay in his son s subversion trial scheduled to start on Thursday in the central city of Wuhan
The defendant is Qin Yongmin a democracy advocate who has spent years in prison and labor camps and has recently promoted an alternative non Communist political party
In a telephone interview Wednesday evening his father Qin Qinguo said that before the trial begins he plans to hand the court a written plea for postponement
If the plea is ignored he said he will walk out
I wouldn t be able to stand it the father a retired steelworker said citing his frail health and high blood pressure
Under China s code of criminal procedure a defendant has the right to a defense lawyer
But in this case the elder Qin said some lawyers he approached declined to take the case while others were warned by security officials not to get involved
The father said he did not agree with his son s political tactics but now he felt he had no choice but to protest his treatment
Qin Yongmin was arrested on Nov
only hours after his mother died of a stroke
He wasn t even allowed to attend the funeral Qin Qinguo said
And now he s not allowed to find a lawyer On Thursday morning a few hundred miles to the east in the city of Hangzhou Wang Youcai is to go on trial on similar charges of inciting subversion
He too has no defense lawyer
Wang was a leader of student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in and served two years in prison after they were put down by military force
As the founder of the suppressed new political party the China Democracy Party he publicly announced its charter in June during President Clinton s visit to China
Scores of people around the country began to champion the new party hopeful that closer ties between China and the United States and China s signing of the international covenant on political and civil rights would mean a looser political climate
But the party was soon declared illegal and many adherents were detained at least temporarily
Wang now faces charges that could land him in prison for five years or more
A third veteran dissident and promoter of the new party Xu Wenli has been detained for weeks in Beijing and is expected to face similar subversion charges
In the last two days at least Democracy Party members or supporters in the Hangzhou area have been detained by the police and others have had their phone lines cut reported the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China based in Hong Kong
