MUNICH Germany AP US prosecutors have asked for a day extension to provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden officials said Saturday
Mamdouh Mahmud Salim of Sudan has been jailed since his arrest near Munich on Sept
by Bavarian authorities acting on a US warrant
Under German law US officials have days after the arrest to turn over supporting evidence so a German court can rule on their extradition request
A Bavarian Justice Ministry spokesman Gerhard Zierl said US authorities a few days ago asked the court hearing the case for an extra days to provide the necessary material
Quoting unidentified Bavarian law enforcement sources Focus newsmagazine reported Saturday that the evidence turned over so far was not very strong
The magazine said much of it was based on the testimony of an FBI informant a former bin Laden associate who made only vague connections between Salim and terrorist activities
Zierl declined to comment on the report but said US authorities probably asked for more time just a precautionary measure
US authorities charge Salim helped finance train and arm members of a terrorist organization including the alleged bombers of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
A criminal complaint unsealed Sept
in US District Court in New York charges him with murder conspiracy and use of weapons of mass destruction
The Taliban s chief justice accused the United States on Wednesday of looking for an excuse to launch another missile attack on his war shattered homeland
And that excuse is Osama bin Laden the man Washington calls Enemy No
and blames for the Aug
bombings of US embassies in East Africa Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an interview with The Associated Press
On Aug
the United States retaliated by firing Tomahawk missiles at suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan killing people
According to US intelligence sources the camps were being used to train members of bin Laden s al Qaeda terrorist group
America is looking for an excuse to fire more rockets on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden Saqib said
Washington which has posted a dlrs million reward for bin Laden s arrest hasn t ruled out further attacks on Afghanistan
Saqib who heads a judicial inquiry established by the Taliban to investigate the terrorism charges against bin Laden says the United States has become insecure
America fears its shadow in every part of the world it is afraid and sees every danger connected to bin Laden he said in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul
In Afghanistan bin Laden is considered an honored guest by his Taliban hosts
They cite Afghan tradition which demands the host guarantee his guest protection
So far Saqib says he has no evidence of bin Laden s involvement in terrorist activities
The Taliban have refused to turn over bin Laden to the United States but they say if there is evidence they will try him under Islamic law
In the percent of Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban a harsh brand of Islamic justice has been imposed including the death penalty
We want good relations with the United States and all Muslim and non Muslim countries but they have to respect our ways he said
Saqib said his inquiry will wind up on Nov
and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the case will be closed at least for the Taliban
Bin Laden is not a sinful man America has been silent they have given no evidence he said
It is too shameful for America who is now seen by all that world to have no reason to go after bin Laden 
Police arrested two journalists and charged them with writing articles to encourage Muslim youths to stage an Islamic revolution in Bangladesh after the Taliban model in Afghanistan a police officer said Thursday
Mufti Abdul Hye and Manzoor Ahmed editors at Jago Mujahid or Wake Up Mujahid a monthy magazine published from Dhaka the Bangladeshi capital were jailed for a month shortly after their arrest on Wednesday
They were arrested under a law that allows police to detain any one for offenses related to national security the officer said on condition of anonymity
Those arrested need not be taken to court for trial for up to three months
Police seized copies of the newspaper for reproducing a foreign newspaper interview of Afghanistan based Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden who has been accused by the United States of masterminding bombing attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August
Under Taliban rules women may not study or work outside their houses and all kinds of light entertainment including music are banned
Men must grow beards of a certain length and criminals are subjected to amputations and public executions Even though Bangladesh is a predominantly Muslim country it is governed by secular laws
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina s liberal government hasn t recognized the Taliban government in Afghanistan
One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August s raid on Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants as possible administration officials now acknowledge
According to the officials White House lawyers conducted a secret review in the months before the attack and concluded that such operations are legal under US and international law
The officials said the raid was timed so that more than cruise missiles would hit bin Laden s camps at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would be meeting there with his chief operatives
A executive order bars anyone working for the US government from plotting or carrying out assassinations
But officials said the White House legal opinion drafted before the Afghan strike asserts that the president has authority to target the infrastructure of terrorist groups that are attacking Americans
A top US counterterrorism official said this week that the infrastructure of bin Laden s group is mostly human As we said from the time of the Aug
strike the objective was to disrupt the training organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden terrorist network at the Khost camps said David C
Leavy a spokesman for the National Security Council at the White House
Targeting infrastructure officials acknowledged can also mean destroying the leadership of a terrorist group
Command and control of an enemy is a justifiable target Leavy said
Senior administration officials said they never discussed killing bin Laden in their planning sessions
His death they said in interviews after the attack would simply have been a side benefit
US intelligence officials say they now believe that bin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack but he appears to have left unscathed before the missiles hit
Officials said there were reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have died in the attack and that total casualties in the complex were between and 
Administration spokesmen have drawn a distinction between attempting to kill a specific person like bin Laden and attacking a group of people who command a terrorist organization
Administration officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill bin Laden a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors with leading a global war against US interests
He has been linked to the Aug
bombing of two US embassies in East Africa
But a less subtle explanation was offered on Oct
by Defense Secretary William Cohen who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United States had been going after bin Laden and his colleagues
We weren t quite successful Cohen continued but we sent a message Kenneth Bacon the Pentagon spokesman said the secretary had not retracted his statements
The Los Angeles Times recently reported that the administration believed that it had a legal right to use deadly force against terrorist leaders
Bin Laden s organization was a significant concern for the Clinton administration even before the bombing of the US embassies in East Africa
Last spring officials said US intelligence considered a daring raid into Afghanistan to capture the Saudi exile
Officials said that at roughly the same time the White House drafted the legal justification for military attacks against a terrorist leadership
That review officials said provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would be gathered
The review by the National Security Council was the basis for saying this operation did not violate the presidential order banning assassinations
That ban was imposed by President Ford in after congressional investigators uncovered evidence that the CIA had plotted to assassinate Fidel Castro the Cuban leader and others
The order said No person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States government shall engage in or conspire to engage in assassination While it is on its face a sweeping and unqualified ban it has been subject to interpretation and intense debate over the years
In the Reagan administration responded to a terrorist attack against US soldiers in Germany with a bombing raid on Libya
The targets included the residence of the Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
And in the Gulf War US forces used powerful bombs in an attempt to kill Saddam Hussein the president of Iraq
The legal review conducted by the White House would appear to provide a precedent for future operations in similar circumstances
Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama Bin Laden the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the August embassy bombings in Africa and that it s members have infiltrated other parts of Europe The Sunday Times reported
The newspaper quoted Fatos Klosi the head of Shik the Albanian intelligence service as saying that Bin Laden s network had sent units to fight in Kosovo the neighboring Serbian province
Egyptians Saudi Arabians Algerians Tunisians Sudanese and Kuwaitis they come from several different organizations Klosi was quoted as telling The Sunday Times
He said he believed terrorists had already infiltrated other parts of Europe from bases in Albania through a traffic in illegal immigrants who have been smuggled across the Mediterranean to Italy in huge numbers
Interpol believes more than blank Albanian passports were stolen in riots last year providing ample opportunity for terrorists to acquire false papers the newspaper said
Apparent confirmation of the Bin Laden s activities came earlier this month during the murder trial of Claude Kader a French national and self confessed member of Bin Laden s Albanian network the newspaper said
Kader claimed during the trial that he had visited Albania to recruit and arm fighters for Kosovo and that four of his associates were still at large
Bin Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian agency wishing to help in Albania the newspaper reported
The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a Sudanese factory destroyed in a US cruise missile strike last month to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden the suspected mastermind of the bombings of two US embassies in East Africa according to US intelligence officials
The evidence the officials said last week shows that Salih Idris the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum has had financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad an Egypt based group responsible for the assassination there of President Anwar Sadat in 
Islamic Jihad in turn receives money and sponsorship from bin Laden and has been absorbed into his terror network the officials added
This evidence was uncovered after the United States destroyed Idris factory in a missile attack following the bombing of the US embassies the officials said
A spokesman for Idris denied the accusations saying Idris had no ties either to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups
In a statement provided by Tim Pendry his London based adviser Idris said I have absolutely no relationship with any Islamic terrorist organization anywhere in the world
I have never met Mr bin Laden I have never spoken with him I have never had any financial or business relationship with him nor knowingly with anyone acting as his agent US officials say they have also received new reports of an increase in the Iraqi presence in Sudan since the missile attack
Officials said they were not certain what the Iraqis were now doing in Khartoum
But intelligence agents previously obtained evidence that the manager of the Shifa plant made frequent trips to Iraq where he visited the head of the chemical weapons program
In addition a soil sample that the CIA clandestinely took at the Shifa plant showed the presence of a chemical used in the production of VX nerve gas a process used only by Iraq
The new evidence comes as President Clinton faces attack over his decision to strike the Shifa plant
Some State Department and CIA officials have objected to the decision arguing that it was based on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden
The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States has poor data on Sudan as the CIA station there has been closed since and the entire US Embassy since 
In addition more than intelligence reports from a CIA informer in Sudan were withdrawn in January because they proved to be fabrications
That year a second informer warned of several terrorist threats including one against Anthony Lake then the national security adviser but his reports proved impossible to confirm
Senior administration officials say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence of Sudan s involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort
Now they say that the new evidence against Idris has confirmed their initial suspicions about Al Shifa
At the time of the Aug
cruise missile attack Clinton administration officials acknowledge they did not know that Idris owned the Shifa factory
The CIA which had begun to scrutinize the plant months earlier believed the plant s ownership was irrelevant
What we knew about the ownership was that a lot of it couldn t be reliably established said one senior US intelligence official
Still after the missile strike when Idris was publicly identified as the owner US intelligence began to investigate his possible connections to chemical weapons and terrorism
A Sudanese expatriate who now lives in Jidda Saudi Arabia Idris was previously a senior manager of the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia
He bought the Shifa plant in March
Officials say US intelligence has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic groups and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation a government entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons development
Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial Corp
in his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production and talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gases against US troops in Saudi Arabia according to US intelligence
But Pendry denied that Idris owned any businesses with the Military Industrial Corp
US intelligence officials declined to provide details about the reports of Idris financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad
But they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated into bin Laden s terrorist campaign
If Osama bin Laden ever stands trial in New York for the bombings of the US embassies in Africa and other acts of terror it is already clear who prosecutors will call as a chief witness One of his senior aides who has been talking to US investigators for two years
The government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym CS saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret proceeding in US district court in Manhattan
According to the government the informant worked closely with bin Laden from to a period when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks on US soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere
From the court papers filed in the investigation of the embassy bombings in East Africa in August it is clear that the informant has provided crucial information to federal investigators
They have cited the source in the papers filed to support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who are under arrest in Germany and Britain
Bin Laden a Saudi exile is thought to be living in Afghanistan
The source is also the basis for many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin Laden himself including the assertion that he directed the attacks on US soldiers in Somalia and that he attempted to obtain nuclear weapons
It is not known whether the source is in custody somewhere or hiding under government protection
As recently as days ago records show the source swore to a page affidavit before a New York notary summarizing his allegations against bin Laden
Government officials adamantly declined to say anything about the identity of CS which stands for confidential source But at least one operative of bin Laden s group in East Africa concluded more than a year ago that he knew the identity of a crucial turncoat Sidi Tayyib a businessman who was married to one of bin Laden s relatives
The operative s concerns were inflamed by a report in a British newspaper that Tayyib was cooperating with Saudi and US authorities
In an August article The Daily Telegraph said Tayyib had been in custody in Saudi Arabia since May and had given intelligence officials details of bin Laden s bank accounts and businesses
The news of Tayyib s possible defection the East African operative wrote in a report apparently intended for the group s commanders almost made me explode
An important man with close links to bin Laden seems to have fallen into the enemy s hands and we have to take all the appropriate security precautions against that the operative Haroun Fazil wrote in his summary of security concerns
Fazil has since been charged in the embassy attacks and remains at large
The report was typed on a computer seized last year by Kenyan authorities according to a government filing last week in US district court in Manhattan
Thus far US prosecutors have charged at least six members of bin Laden s organization with terrorist activities or conspiracy
In one recent filing they said their case will in part be based on the testimony of the confidential source suggesting that the informant has agreed to testify at any trial of bin Laden or his associates
The arrangement appears to have resulted from a plea bargain in which the source is cooperating in hopes of receiving a lesser sentence
There is no indication that the source has yet been sentenced and it seems likely that sentencing would take place after the investigation and ensuing trials are complete
In the affidavit prepared last week the source acknowledged pleading guilty to terrorism charges in the United States and said they stemmed from attacks on US targets which were not specifically identified
The source described taking an oath of allegiance to follow bin Laden s orders and gave a detailed account of bin Laden s group including its history and inner workings
The source told of private statements by bin Laden to other al Qaeda members encouraging them to attack US troops and other citizens stationed in the Middle East and Africa
I either heard these statements myself the source said or I read them or learned of them from other al Qaeda members The government has also said in other court papers that the source helped identify bin Laden s signature on a document urging Muslims to kill Americans
Tayyib s whereabouts are unknown and he could not be reached for comment
The man accused of orchestrating the US embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan where he has lived for years with the permission of the hard line Islamic Taliban militia
The Taliban who control about percent of Afghanistan on Friday closed their three week inquiry into allegations that Osama bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States
It s over and America has not presented any evidence Afghanistan s chief justice Noor Mohammed Saqib told The Associated Press in an interview at the Supreme Court building in the Afghan capital Kabul
Without any evidence bin Laden is a man without sin
He is a free man The Taliban have told bin Laden however that political activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that the Taliban information minister said in a statement Friday
The minister Amir Khan Muttaqi also disputed US assertions that bin Laden is a rich man saying the Saudi dissident has had his foreign assets frozen a claim not immediately corroborated
NAIROBI Kenya AP FBI agents this week began questioning relatives of the victims of the Aug
US Embassy bombing as well as the seriously injured on request of the US Attorney s office for the Southern District of New York a US official said Thursday
The blast at the embassy building in downtown Nairobi killed people of them Americans and injured 
In an nearly simultaneous bombing of the US Embassy in Dar es Salaam in neighboring Tanzania people were killed and were injured none of them Americans
The official who could not be further identified said the questioning was aimed at gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the pre sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection with the attack
Wadih El Hage Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al Owhali are being held by the US District Court in the Southern District of New York
All three have pleaded innocent
Fazul Abdullah Mohammed is a fugitive
Saudi exile Osama bin Laden the alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack US targets around the world and Muhammad Atef the alleged military commander of bin Laden s terrorist organization Al Qaeda were charged in a separate page indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings
Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan
US law provides for the trial in the United States of those charged in terror attacks against American citizens even if carried out on foreign soil
Sometime in the summer of an operative for Osama bin Laden sat down at his personal computer in a hideaway in Kenya
He was worried he wrote in an angry dispatch about the security of the East Africa network of bin Laden the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans
The organization the author complained had declared war against the United States yet he had learned of that only from the news media
The writer who federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil who was to become one of the central suspects in the bombing of the US Embassy in Nairobi a year later noted with alarm British press reports about the arrest of an aide to bin Laden
Striking almost bureaucratic tones he said he was worried that an important man with close links to bin Laden seemed to have fallen into the enemy s hands He said the Americans were breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that he had to take precautions
The cell is at percent danger the operative warned
The letter an extraordinary bit of digital evidence in a cloak and dagger case was retrieved from a computer in a house where Fazil had been staying according to papers filed in US District Court in New York City
The papers said the computer was seized in August in a raid by Kenyan authorities that was attended by an FBI agent
The documents did not make clear whether the FBI had translated and read the document before or after the bombings of the US Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam Tanzania on Aug
of this year
The timing is potentially important because there have been mounting questions since the bombings about whether the United States adequately followed up warnings of a possible terrorist attack on American targets in Kenya
Officials of the FBI and the US attorney s office in New York City refused to say Tuesday night at what point FBI agents learned of the computer file nor would they make any other comment
Fazil eluded American investigators after the bombing as he traveled from Kenya to his home in the Comoros Islands and then to the Middle East
He remains a fugitive
The dispatch provides a remarkable insight into the workings of a terrorist network in the twilight of the th century
The author talks of how he and his fellow operatives follow events on CNN and use the Internet to communicate
He refers to himself as the media information officer of the East Africa cell and complains that he is not being kept in the loop on big decisions
Along the way in an almost casual fashion the document seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against bin Laden That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden s door by federal authorities the attacks on American soldiers in Somalia in and 
The writer of the document warned that the followers of bin Laden whom he referred to as the sheik had become America s primary target He said his comrades in East Africa should know that there is an American Kenyan Egyptian intelligence activity in Nairobi aiming to identify the names and residences of the members who are associated with the sheik since America knows well that the youth who lived in Somalia and were members of the sheik s cell are the ones who killed Americans in Somalia They know that since Kenya was the main gateway for those members there must be a center in Kenya he wrote concluding We are really in danger The government has asserted that one of Fazil s duties was to prepare and transmit reports to bin Laden and his top lieutenants
Federal authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz a London based associate of bin Laden directed Fazil to report periodically to bin Laden about the security situation of the cell
Fawwaz who served as an informal press spokesman for bin Laden in London was arrested by British authorities in September after the embassy bombings
He has denied any connection to terrorist activities
A translation of the report was part of a package of documents American prosecutors have sent to Britain to support the extradition of Fawwaz for trial in New York
It is not clear from the materials whether the report in the computer was forwarded to bin Laden
The documents which were initially filed in secret include a federal complaint that accuses Fawwaz of conspiring with bin Laden to kill Americans overseas
A second count charges him with soliciting others to do so
The report made clear that the organization was being run on a shoestring
Its author wrote that his mother has fallen ill and that he would like to return to his homeland for a visit
What do you think Keep in mind we only have He repeatedly expressed his fears of American intelligence which he believed was in the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associates
There is a war and the situation is dangerous he said
He wrote that American forces kidnapped anyone who threatened the national security or American citizens
The author noted with alarm a recent CIA operation in which a man accused of shooting agency employees had been lured across the border in Pakistan and returned to the United States for trial
According to federal authorities Fazil went on to play a pivotal role in the bombing of the Nairobi embassy
Prosecutors assert that he rented the villa where the bomb was assembled and surveyed the embassy s security precautions
On Aug
they charge Fazil drove a pickup truck to the embassy leading the way for a vehicle carrying the bomb that killed more than people including Americans
The author of the report said that he stood ready to fight the forces of atheism and dictators who wreaked havoc on earth He said that the group did not have to inform its Nairobi based operatives of all its global plans but they needed enough warning to go underground for a while if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi
We the East Africa cell members do not want to know about the operations plans he wrote since we are just implementers
