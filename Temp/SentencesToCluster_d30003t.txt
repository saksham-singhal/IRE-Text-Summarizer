Both myself and Mr Aznar agree this is not a matter for us to discuss British Prime Minister Tony Blair said referring to Spanish leader Jose Maria Aznar
I ve avoided commenting on that judicial process and I don t intend to do so Aznar made similar comments when he meet journalists on the margin of a European Union summit in this Alpine lakeside resort
Pinochet is under arrest in a London hospital where he d gone for back surgery

It s important we don t talk nonsense about this issue
This is stupid

I would like to ask for compassion for a person who is very very very ill Pinochet had surgery Oct
for a herniated disc a painful spinal disorder which had hindered his movement
He was arrested Oct

The Spanish warrant cited victims but could be broadened to include some people who were killed or disappeared during his year rule
Chile argues that Pinochet must be released because as a senator he enjoys diplomatic immunity and because he is in poor health
Unconfirmed media reports in Chile this week indicated that Pinochet who has worn a pacemaker for years and is diabetic also has a urinary tract infection

As his lawyers in London tried to quash a Spanish arrest warrant for Gen
Augusto Pinochet the former Chilean dictator efforts began in Geneva and Paris to have him extradited
In London where Pinochet has been under arrest in a clinic for the last days a phalanx of British lawyers argued before the High Court of Justice that the arrest order sent from Spain was illegal because the general is not a Spanish citizen
They also maintained that as a former head of state the general had diplomatic immunity for actions taken while in office
His lawyer Clive Nicholls said that if a bid to extradite the general succeeded by the same token Queen Elizabeth II could be extradited to Argentina to face trial for the death of Argentine soldiers in the Falklands war in 
On the opposing side Alun Jones a British government lawyer acting as prosecutor in the case defended the Spanish warrant which led to the general s detention in London
The prosecutor argued that the the right wing general was responsible for killing at least people and had set out to destroy a national group Chilean nationals who did not share his ideological values After hearing the arguments in a court crowded with Chilean exiles in the public gallery Lord Bingham Britain s senior judge said the court was expected to decide the matter on Tuesday
The Chilean air force has sent an ambulance plane to Britain in hope of the general s early release
But efforts to prevent that gathered strength elsewhere in Europe
In Geneva a public prosecutor Bernard Bertossa said Monday that he had issued a warrant for Pinochet s arrest in connection with the kidnapping and presumed death of a Swiss Chilean citizen in 
Bertossa said he had opened a judicial investigation in response to a complaint by the widow of the victim Alexei Jaccard who was when he was tortured in Chile and subsequently disappeared

In addition a human rights group in Paris said Monday that it had filed a suit with a Paris court on behalf of Anne Marie Pesle whose father Etienne Pesle disappeared in Chile in 
In Madrid Baltasar Garzon the Spanish investigating magistrate who first obtained Pinochet s arrest in London said he had formally requested the governments of Switzerland and Luxemburg to block bank accounts held by the general
Court officials in Madrid said Garzon wanted any accounts blocked with a view to their possible use later as compensation to relatives of victims
In London British officials keep insisting that Pinochet s case will be decided by the courts and not politically yet the issue has stirred intense political activity both in Britain and in Chile
Supporters and opponents of the dictator have traveled to the London clinic where he is being held
From Chile have come six right wing senators the deputy foreign minister aides and legal experts who file in and out of the private clinic in central London
From Europe have come dozens of longtime opponents of the general who were forced into exile after his coup against the elected Socialist president Salvador Allende Gossens
The exiles along with others stand daily outside the clinic holding up photographs of missing relatives and shouting anti Pinochet slogans

He is ill and in a few days he will be Mariano Fernandez Chile s deputy foreign minister said after visiting Pinochet who had minor surgery for a back ailment
After his surgery on Oct
the general was arrested by Scotland Yard during the night of Oct
The diplomatic and judicial entanglements that ensued now involve at least five governments
The political and legal imbroglio could end if Britain s home secretary Jack Straw decides that the general should be released on compassionate grounds because of his age and failing health
Last week he said that in exercising his powers under the Extradition Act he would consider whether the offenses are of a political character and he would take into account any compassionate circumstances 
A delegation of Chilean legislators lobbying against the possible extradition of Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial warned Thursday that Chile was on the brink of political turmoil
There is a climate of division confrontation and instability in Chile parliamentary deputy Alberto Espina told reporters in Madrid after meeting the Chilean ambassador
Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct
at the instigation of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who is seeking to extradite the former dictator on charges of genocide terrorism and torture
In Chile the detention triggered both celebrations by relatives of victims of Pinochet s regime and protests from the retired general s supporters
Espina also warned that the issue was damaging relations between Chile Spain and Britain
Spain was the biggest single investor in Chile last year followed closely by Britain
The deputy arrived in Madrid late Wednesday accompanied by the senators Jovino Movoa and Julio Lagos
The delegation is an offshoot of a larger group of Chilean parliamentarians currently protesting the detention in London on behalf of the opposition parties Independent Democratic Union and the National Renovation Party
Espina Movoa and Lagos were hoping to talk to officials from the Spanish Foreign Ministry and other government representatives
All we ask is that Spain stops meddling in our internal affairs Espina said arguing that Chilean problems should be dealt with by Chilean courts
We stopped being a Spanish colony years ago and we have no intention of becoming one again he added
Government spokesman Josep Pique said Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar had no plans to meet the delegation the state owned news agency EFE reported
Aznar has promised his government will rubber stamp a formal extradition request to the British government if asked to do so by the judicial authorities
But the extradition attempt could be annulled by legal challenges in Spain well before the deadline for presenting it in Britain
The deadline is set for November th coincidentally Pinochet s rd birthday
On Thursday the head prosecutor from the National Court set in motion appeals against several rulings made by Judge Garzon related to Pinochet s detention in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery
The court s plenary is expected to meet next week to decide on an earlier challenge of the Spanish judicial investigations into human rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon s arrest warrant
A ruling that the investigations are outside the jurisdiction of Spanish law would made any extradition request difficult
The decision is likely to hang on how genocide and terrorism are interpreted as these crimes are specifically mentioned in the Spanish legal code
Margaret Thatcher entertained former Children dictator Gen
Augusto Pinochet at her home two weeks before he was arrested in his bed in a London hospital the ex prime minister s office said Tuesday amid growing diplomatic and domestic controversy over the move
Pinochet who has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him to Spain on allegations of murder genocide and torture had drinks with Lady Thatcher and her husband Denis in their home in London s elite Belgravia district four days before he was hospitalized for back surgery performed Oct
She regarded it as a private meeting said Mark Worthington spokesman for the Lady Thatcher Conservative Party prime minister from 
The year old Pinochet was arrested Friday at a Spanish magistrate s request
In Conservative government days Pinochet was welcomed on regular visits that included tea with the prime minister
He was the only Latin American leader to support Britain in its war against Argentina to reclaim the Falkland Islands
Pinochet and Lady Thatcher also implemented similar brands of right wing economics
The current visit is Pincohet s first since Prime Minister Tony Blair s Labor Party administration was elected months ago ending years of Conservative Party rule
Chile s ambassador delivered a formal protest to the Foreign Office on Monday saying Britain has violated Pinochet s diplomatic immunity
He arrived last month on a diplomatic passport and is also a senator for life in Chile which protects him from prosecution there
Pinochet s year rule was marked by torture and other human rights abuses against political opponents in which the Chilean government has said people were killed or vanished
He remained Chilean army commander in chief until March
The magistrate broadened his charges Monday to include killings of Chileans as well as Spaniards and genocide for which there is no diplomatic immunity
Chilean Ambassador Mario Artaza himself an exile during Pinochet s rule said Chile had a duty to protect a citizen with diplomatic immunity and senator status
We are not protecting the dictator of the s Artaza said in a British Broadcasting Corp
radio interview Tuesday
What we are fighting for and discussing with the British government is the special situation of a senator in our transition who many people do not understand and many people don t like We re not discussing his record during his period of dictatorship that the present government does not support at all added the ambassador
A Chilean specialist in international law was traveling to London for further meetings with British officials Artaza said
Pinochet expected to be hospitalized for perhaps two more weeks faces a long battle through British courts to avoid extradition questioning by two Spanish judges who instigated the proceedings and an appearance at London s Bow Street magistrate s court
British Conservative Party lawmakers accuse the Labor government of gesture politics and pandering to the party s left wing
Britain has defended its arrest of Gen
Augusto Pinochet with one lawmaker saying that Chile s claim that the former Chilean dictator has diplomatic immunity is ridiculous
Chilean officials meanwhile issued strong protests and sent a delegation to London on Sunday to argue for Pinochet s release
The former strongman s son vowed to hire top attorneys to defend his year old father who ruled Chile with an iron fist for years
British police arrested Pinochet in his bed Friday at a private London hospital in response to a request from Spain which wants to question Pinochet about allegations of murder during the decade after he seized power in 
Pinochet had gone to the hospital to have a back operation Oct
The idea that such a brutal dictator as Pinochet should be claiming diplomatic immunity I think for most people in this country would be pretty gut wrenching stuff Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson said in a British Broadcasting Corp
television interview Sunday
Home Office Minister Alun Michael acknowledged Sunday that Pinochet entered Britain on a diplomatic passport but said That does not necessarily convey diplomatic immunity The Foreign Office said only government officials visiting on official business and accredited diplomats have immunity
Pinochet has been a regular visitor to Britain generally without publicity
His arrest this time appeared to reflect a tougher attitude toward right wing dictators by Prime Minister Tony Blair s Labor Party government which replaced a Conservative Party administration months ago and promised an ethical foreign policy
However Michael Howard a Conservative spokesman and former Cabinet minister said he was concerned that Pinochet was arrested as a result of pressure from Labor lawmakers and lobby groups
Chilean President Eduardo Frei criticized the arrest saying the Spanish magistrate s arrest order was tantamount to not recognizing Chile s institutions
Spain also lived under an authoritarian for years and many of its present institutions are inherited from that regime Frei said in Porto Portugal where he was attending the Ibero American Summit
Would a Chilean court be allowed to start a trial for abuses that occurred under the Spanish authoritarian regime of Francisco Franco Frei asked
It is only for Chilean courts to try events that occurred in Chile Franco s reign ended in 
Pinochet s family issued a statement Sunday calling the arrest an insult and thanking the Chilean government rightist politicians and the military for their support
In London police guards were deployed Sunday outside the London Clinic where Pinochet is believed to still be a patient
About Chilean demonstrators pleased with the arrest gathered outside chanting and waving placards bearing faded black and white portraits with the caption Disappeared in Chile Across the Atlantic the Chilean capital of Santiago was the scene of dueling demonstrations Sunday reflecting the long standing division of public opinion over Pinochet
The rallies were mostly peaceful although riot police used tear gas and water cannons on some pro Pinochet protesters trying to break through police lines into the British embassy on Sunday evening
No arrests or injuries were reported
The envoy sent to London to argue for Pinochet s release Santiago Benadava would offer only diplomatic advice said Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza
Any legal defense would be up to Pinochet s family
Pinochet s son Augusto said the family would hire the best legal team available in London Several right wing Chilean politicians including some who held posts in the Pinochet regime also were flying to London to show their support to their former boss
Under extradition laws Spain has days from last Friday to formally apply for extradition
The final decision lies with British Home Secretary Jack Straw
There was no immediate word on when Pinochet would be questioned
But police sources speaking on condition of anonymity said questioning was not expected for a week or two
Pinochet has been widely accused of running a ruthless regime marked by disappearances and deaths of political opponents
His arrest was prompted by applications last week to question him by two Spanish judges investigating human rights violations
One of them Baltasar Garzon also wants to question Pinochet about the disappearances of Chilean dissidents in Argentina
The arrest warrant however referred only to questioning about allegations that he killed Spaniards in Chile between and 
In Chile seven Spaniards have been identified as missing or dead under the Pinochet regime including two Catholic priests and a UN official
According to a Chilean government report a total of political opponents died or disappeared during Pinochet s term
Pinochet commander in chief of the Chilean army until March has immunity from prosecution in Chile as a senator for life under a new constitution that his government crafted
He is also covered under an amnesty for crimes committed before when most of the human rights abuses took place
The Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain
Despite everything that has been written this is not a decision for the British government or the Spanish government British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in an interview published by a Spanish newspaper on Wednesday
In a similar vein Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman Joaquin Perez said Wednesday The government should not have any opinion about the extradition British police acting on an international arrest warrant from Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon on Friday detained the ailing general in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery
The detention and the possible extradition of Pinochet to Spain to stand trial for genocide terrorism and torture during his year dictatorship was warmly welcomed by human rights activists worldwide
But it sparked protests from the Chilean government and fears it could damage economic relations
In seven years after Pinochet left power Spain was the biggest single investor in Chile followed closely by Britain
Blair quoted in the El Mundo newspaper said that Pinochet s detention was unrelated to his government s so called Ethical Foreign Policy apparently ignoring pressure from leftists within his Labor party to support moves to prosecute the former dictator
This is about two legal systems united by an extradition treaty but nobody seems to understand this he said
Blair added that should Home Secretary Jack Straw would use only strictly legal criteria and act as if he were a judge should he be required to make a decision on an extradition request from Spain
The tone of the British Prime Minister s first public comment on the issue contrasted sharply with Sunday s emotional statement from influential Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson who said most Britons would find diplomatic immunity for Pinochet gut wrenching The European extradition convention gives Garzon days to present a formal extradition request to the British authorities via the Spanish government
But while Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has promised his government would rubber stamp the process if it reaches his desk he appears to be hoping he will never have to do so
Public prosecutors from Spain s National Court have appealed the judicial investigations into human rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon s arrest warrant
Depending on the result of the appeals it is possible that it the extradition request will never reach the government so perhaps the government will never have to pronounce on it Aznar was quoted as saying in Wednesday s edition of the Madrid newspaper El Pais
The appeals argue that crimes committed during Pinochet s dictatorship are none of Spain s business and should be left to the Chilean or international courts
A ruling on the appeals is expected next week and a decision in their favor would nullify Garzon s extradition attempt
Europe s top official said Friday that he hoped former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet would be extradited to Spain to be tried for crimes committed during his year rule
Sometimes it should be made clear that crimes wherever they take place cannot be left unpunished European Commission President Jacques Santer said
Pinochet was detained by British police in London on Oct
by request of a Spanish magistrate as a first step toward his extradition to stand trial for genocide and terrorism
The dictatorship caused great suffering and sent many citizens into exile Santer said referring to the Pinochet regime
Santer was speaking to reporters in the northern Spanish city of Oviedo where he was due to receive the Prince of Asturias Prize for social science one of the eight annual prizes named after the heir to the Spanish throne
Meanwhile a Spanish newspaper reported Friday that Pinochet is not fully aware of his predicament
Daily El Mundo said the ailing retired general s family and aides have been shielding him from the details for fear he would fly into a rage that would kill him
Pinochet was detained in the London clinic while recovering from back surgery
El Mundo said its reporter accompanied Chilean politicians seeking his release during a visit to the clinic Thursday
The reporter said he talked briefly to Pinochet s wife Lucia Hiriart and daughter Veronica
If Augusto knew the truth he would have an attack of rage and die El Mundo quoted Hiriart as saying to others while waiting for permission from Scotland Yard to visit her husband on the eighth floor of the clinic
She said she was particularly concerned because he is also suffering from a urinary infection heart problems and diabetes the newspaper reported
El Mundo reported that the family had asked police guards to stand outside the former dictator s room and keep out of sight
The paper said the room lacked television radio or telephone
According to the report Pinochet was informed of the arrest order from two policemen but is convinced it was a mistake and that he is protected by diplomatic immunity
Meanwhile a Chilean television station reported Friday that a Chilean army officer close to Pinochet told the former military chief about his situation after flying to London Thursday
TV reported that the unidentified officer said Pinochet reacted calmly to the news imparted as one soldier to another 
Cuban President Fidel Castro said Sunday he disagreed with the arrest in London of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet calling it a case of international meddling It seems to me that what has happened there in London is universal meddling Castro told reporters covering the Ibero American summit being held here Sunday
Castro had just finished breakfast with King Juan Carlos of Spain in a city hotel
He said the case seemed to be unprecedented and unusual Pinochet was placed under arrest in London Friday by British police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge
The judge is probing Pinochet s role in the death of Spaniards in Chile under his rule in the s and s
The Chilean government has protested Pinochet s arrest insisting that as a senator he was traveling on a diplomatic passport and had immunity from arrest
Castro Latin America s only remaining authoritarian leader said he lacked details on the case against Pinochet but said he thought it placed the government of Chile and President Eduardo Frei in an uncomfortable position while Frei is attending the summit
Castro compared the action with the establishment in Rome in August of an International Criminal Court a move Cuba has expressed reservations about
Castro said the court ought to be independent of the UN Security Council because we already know who commands there an apparent reference to the United States
The United States was one of only seven countries that voted against creating the court
The Pinochet case is serious the problem is delicate and the reactions of the Chilean Parliament and armed forces bear watching Castro said
He expressed surprise that the British had arrested Pinochet especially since he had provided support to England during its war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands
Although Chile maintained neutrality during the war it was accused of providing military intelligence to the British
Castro joked that he would have thought police could have waited another hours to avoid having the arrest of Pinochet overshadow the summit being held here
Now they are talking about the arrest of Pinochet instead of the summit he said
Pinochet left government in but remained as army chief until March when he became a senator for life
