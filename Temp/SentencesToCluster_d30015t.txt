The American envoy Richard Holbrooke met with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia Monday night and according to American diplomats told him that he had to take further steps to pull back his military in Kosovo Province or face a NATO attack
Milosevic was also told the diplomats said that he had to insure that the roughly ethnic Albanian refugees who have been forced to flee their homes in the fighting in the last six months be allowed to return home
Most of these refugees are reluctant to return because many of the Serb police officers who destroyed their homes and villages remain in the neighborhoods
After delivering his sternest message so far to Milosevic over the Kosovo conflict Holbrooke said at a news conference that NATO s military plans for attacking Serbia were moving ahead on a serious intense and sustained basis Holbrooke s mission to Milosevic was described by the American diplomats as not a do or die trip but they added We re at a very serious juncture Shortly after Holbrooke s meeting with Milosevic the Yugoslav leader issued a defiant statement on Serbian television in which he said the threats of aggression outlined by Holbrooke represented a criminal act Milosevic who rarely comments about his meetings with foreign diplomats and whose tough words cast an unusually ominous tone also said that Holbrooke s position constituted support for Albanian terrorists and not the Albanian people Milosevic was apparently accusing Holbrooke of supporting the ethnic Albanian guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army who have been fighting to make the Serbian province of Kosovo an independent nation
The Yugoslav leader added that for more than seven days there have been no skirmishes or military action An American diplomat familiar with the themes Holbrooke planned to stress to Milosevic said there had been no expectation that the American envoy would walk out Monday night with an agreement
Rather the point was to underscore to the Yugoslav leader and make explicit what was expected of him
It was not quite an ultimatum the diplomat said but more a matter of what steps have to be taken to show compliance The essence of Holbrooke s demands centered on issues outlined in a United Nations Security Council resolution of two weeks ago
The resolution ordered Milosevic to withdraw the extra army and police forces that were sent to Kosovo to deal with the guerrillas and to send back to their bases the military forces normally stationed in the province
So far American diplomats said Milosevic has withdrawn troops from the field but not all of them are in their barracks
Such a move is essential American diplomats said to create a conducive atmosphere for any possible negotiations on the future status of the province
The UN resolution also calls for a political solution
Holbrooke and the US ambassador to Macedonia Christopher Hill discussed with Milosevic a political document drawn up by the State Department that calls for broad autonomy for Kosovo
Milosevic withdrew the autonomy in as he began his campaign of Serb nationalism
The countryside in central Kosovo has been eerily silent since last Thursday
The sound of artillery thuds and mortar rounds have been noticeably absent and the coils of white smoke that signified burning villages have vanished from the green hills and valleys
Police checkpoints are more relaxed and areas that were sealed off this time last week by the Yugoslav army are now open to the patrols of diplomatic monitors from the United States European Union and Russia
These monitors many of whom are former military officers have reported that the Yugoslav army has stood down and that they have seen virtually no military action since late last week
There has been sporadic shooting the monitors have reported
But this superficial calm is not good enough because the Serb military has the capacity to resume fighting very quickly a NATO military officer said Monday
The officer added that a cease fire in Kosovo is pretty much enacted He also said that the trend toward compliance is positive The interior ministry police must also reduce their presence around villages so that refugees who have fled have the confidence to return the military officer said
Some interior ministry police officers had left the province but not enough he added
On the question of how badly damaged the KLA had been by the Yugoslav army s three month offensive the NATO officer said It s a fair assessment that the KLA is dismantled but not destroyed Holbrooke s first stop Monday was Brussels where he met with the secretary general of NATO Javier Solana
On Tuesday he plans to travel to Pristina the capital of Kosovo where he is scheduled to meet with the ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova to present the political proposal for the future status of Kosovo
He is expected back in Belgrade on Tuesday afternoon for another session with Milosevic
With NATO attacks said to be only days away top US envoy Richard Holbrooke delivered an th hour warning Monday to Yugoslavia s president to halt his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or face airstrikes
But there was no sign that Slobodan Milosevic was backing down
Following his meeting with Holbrooke Milosevic s office issued a statement denouncing NATO threats as a criminal act which favored separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas
The statement broadcast by government television said there had been no fighting in the Serbian province for the past seven days and that the crisis represented no threat to other countries in the southern Balkans
Holbrooke the US ambassador designate to the United Nations met with Milosevic for several hours late Monday after arriving from Brussels Belgium where he conferred with senior NATO officials
There was no statement from Holbrooke after the meeting
Before boarding a plane for Belgrade however Holbrooke said conditions in the southern Serbian province had not improved since the alliance started two weeks ago to finalize plans for air raids to force Milosevic to halt his offensive against Kosovo Albanian separatists
Holbrooke said he planned to drive home to Milosevic the extreme gravity of the situation Holbrooke negotiated the peace deal with Milosevic and other Balkan leaders that ended the and one half year Bosnian war in 
In Washington President Clinton expressed concern that Milosevic was playing the classic game of making false promises to avoid NATO military strikes
Clinton in a telephone call with Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Milosevic s compliance with UN demands must be verifiable tangible and irreversible press secretary Joe Lockhart said at the White House
What happens next depends on President Milosevic Lockhart quoted the president telling the Russian leader who has opposed the use of force against Moscow s longtime ally
As Holbrooke tried to resolve the crisis through negotiations British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said a decision on NATO military action was imminent
We are getting ready for NATO action and later this week we will expect a decision to be taken Cook told reporters after a special session of the Cabinet called by Prime Minister Tony Blair
In Brussels NATO officials said they were ready to launch airstrikes within hours of receiving an order to attack
If that first airstrike failed to deter Serb forces a senior NATO official said on condition of anonymity the alliance could unleash a fully fledged air campaign involving hundreds of planes
At the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan said Yugoslav forces had increased their attacks on Kosovo s ethnic Albanians even after a UN resolution demanded a cease fire
In a widely anticipated report to the Security Council Annan listed apparent violations of a Sept
UN resolution decried the appalling atrocities in Kosovo and said it was clear beyond any reasonable doubt that Yugoslav forces were responsible for the bulk of them
The UN chief also said rebel forces of the Kosovo Liberation Army also were responsible for human rights violations a charge the KLA quickly denied
NATO countries had been awaiting the UN chief s report to determine whether to use military force to stop the offensive on ethnic Albanians who are seeking autonomy like they had until if not independence from Yugoslavia
Albanians in the province outnumber Serbs to 
Despite Annan s unwillingness to declare Serb noncompliance State Department spokesman James Foley said the Clinton administration believed Milosevic had not met the conditions laid down by the Security Council
Briefing reporters in Washington Foley cited the absence of a formal cease fire the failure to arrange a meaningful dialogue with ethnic Albanian leaders and the continued presence of major army units in southeastern Kosovo near Albania s border
Meanwhile Yugoslavia s prime minister told an emergency session of parliament Monday that the country is faced with the imminent danger of war Yugoslavia is comprised of dominant Serbia and smaller Montenegro
The threats are serious Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said
And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia is faced with the imminent danger of war
Yugoslavia has to defend itself if it was attacked One option was for parliament to declare a state of emergency a step toward a mobilization of all military aged men
But the parliament voted to introduce the measure when the first bomb drops on our territory In an attempt to head off NATO action Bulatovic said the government had accepted a Russian proposal for an investigation by the nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo until Yugoslav membership in the organization is restored
The prime minister also said there was no longer any fighting in Kosovo which has million residents
He said five of the special police units had been removed from Kosovo and the others had been returned to their barracks in the province
One diplomat in Kosovo who spoke on condition of anonymity said there has been a significant redeployment of Yugoslav army troops out of Kosovo to other parts of Serbia including a mechanized brigade that pulled out Sunday
Some army units remain in the field and there is enormous fear that violence will resume particularly among refugees tens of thousands of whom are living in the hills and forests without shelter
BRUSSELS Belgium AP US special envoy Richard Holbrooke said Monday the military situation in Kosovo was as bad now as two weeks ago

KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said in a statement published Monday by the Albanian language newspaper Bujku that we wish they airstrikes would become reality and we shall provide assistance if it is asked of us Krasniqi accused ethnic Albanian politicians of having given up on independence and having become the servants of the enemy by agreeing to accept autonomy but not independence

The European Union nations were divided Monday on whether to launch air strikes without UN Security Council backing

Some army units remain in the field and there is enormous fear that violence will resume particularly among refugees tens of thousands of whom are living in the hills and forests without shelter
Under NATO threat to end his punishing offensive against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has ordered most units of his army back to their barracks and may well avoid an attack by the alliance military observers and diplomats say
Milosevic who on one hand is excoriated by Washington as the scourge of Kosovo yet on the other hand is treated as key to peace in Bosnia acted as the European Union NATO and the United Nations prepared for a review on Monday of possible military intervention
Russia stepped up its warnings against such action and dispatched its foreign and defense ministers on an unusually high level mission to see the Yugoslav president Sunday in Belgrade
As he has so often Milosevic appears to have bowed to foreign demands in the nick of time and yet still accomplished what he wanted
This weekend foreign diplomatic observers in Kosovo reported that a military stand down had taken place in the province where Milosevic s forces have waged a fierce offensive against Albanian rebels
The observers said that except for segments of three brigades most units of the Yugoslav army were home The daily reports of the observer mission made up of US European Union and Russian military experts are one of the key elements in helping Washington and European capitals decide whether Milosevic has met their demands for a cease fire
By putting the army back in its barracks sending some police units out of Kosovo and ordering an end to burning and looting of villages Milosevic may well avoid a NATO attack diplomats here and in Washington said
But at the same time they acknowledge that while NATO looked the other way he enjoyed a three month license to overwhelm the Kosovo Liberation Army the rebel army fighting for independence for Kosovo and its ethnic Albanian majority and terrorize the rural civilian population that supports it
His military operation created more than refugees whom the Clinton administration is gearing up to take care of this winter through a variety of relief organizations
US officials said they expected Richard Holbrooke the US envoy who dealt with Milosevic in negotiating an end to the war in Bosnia to meet with him on Monday to discuss a political plan for Kosovo
The heart of the disagreement in Kosovo is between Serbia Yugoslavia s principal republic which insists on keeping Kosovo as a province and the ethnic Albanians there who have chafed under Milosevic s repression since he stripped the province of virtual autonomy in and who now seek independence
The West fearing the precedent that independence for Kosovo would set in other conflicts in the world has been trying to mediate a middle course
In essence diplomats said they believed that the plan Holbrooke will present to Milosevic calls for a three year interim period leading to a status fairly close to the pre autonomy arrangement
Since the Kosovo conflict flared up in March critics of Washington s policy toward Milosevic argue that he has been able to choreograph every move to suit his goal pushing the Albanian population into submission with impunity
The United States and its allies have waited four months while he cleaned the clock of the Kosovo Liberation Army said Morton Abramowitz head of the International Crisis Group a policy analysis organization and taken three weeks to discuss military action with the result that Albanian villages were destroyed Administration officials now acknowledge that when NATO failed to live up to its earlier threat in June to strike Serbia Milosevic took advantage of the indecision and plunged ahead with an artillery and tank offensive against the lightly armed guerrilla forces whose bedrock of popular support had helped win them effective control of large swaths of Kosovo territory including key roads
While he was doing that Milosevic skillfully managed a key requirement for Washington he made sure that the war did not spill over into neighboring Albania and Macedonia fragile countries in a traditionally volatile area
All along the biggest fear in Washington has been that the Kosovo conflict would engulf neighboring countries and encourage Albania and the ethnic Albanian population in Macedonia to join the cause
Such a possibility raised the specter of a new Balkans conflict just three years after peace was secured in Bosnia
Milosevic catered to Washington s concern that the conflict be contained
The Yugoslav army mined Kosovo s borders with Macedonia and Albania ensuring that few refugees could escape and limiting routes for arms supplies for the rebels
The Yugoslav leader also understood that Washington was unsure about how to deal with the disorganized Albanian political leadership in Kosovo and the unbending Kosovo Liberation Army whose main chiefs were hardened emigres returned from Switzerland and Germany
For example Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic to meet in May with Ibrahim Rugova the top Albanian political leader in Kosovo an encounter that turned out to be little more than a photo opportunity
For that procedural breakthrough Holbrooke recommended the lifting of a ban on foreign investment in Serbia that had been put in place the month before
After meeting with Rugova Milosevic stepped up his military operations in Kosovo forcing Washington to reverse itself again and carry out the investment ban
In late June Holbrooke met with two self styled Kosovo guerrilla commanders in the province s western town of Junik but then broke off all contact
Clinton administration officials said at the time that they were concerned that NATO intervention would bolster the separatist forces
To try to put the best face on the situation Washington worked with Moscow to get Milosevic to accept the presence of international monitors who would patrol Kosovo and report on military action
The monitors were slow in getting organized
By August when the Yugoslav army backed by the Serbian special police were in full swing against the rebels and burning and looting villages in the process the monitors found it difficult to gain access to the fighting
They drove up to roadblocks knew something was going on from the sounds and the smoke but could not be precise
In recent days as the tanks and artillery have withdrawn access has improved the monitors say
But there are some areas in central Kosovo around Likovac and Gornje Obrinje that the monitors have ruled off limits because of land mines on the roads
The mines are believed to have been planted by the guerrillas
Gornje Obrinje was the site of a massacre of ethnic Albanian women children and elderly people on Sept
A British reporter who walked across fields into the village on Sunday said about mortar shells apparently from the Serbian police or the Yugoslav army were fired at the village early Sunday afternoon
The Yugoslav army and police forces have been responsible for the vast majority of atrocities in the Kosovo conflict said a report by New York based group Human Rights Watch released here on Sunday
The report said the rebels had also violated the laws of war by taking civilian hostages and carrying out summary executions
But the violations by the guerrillas were on a lesser scale than the government abuses the author of the report Fred Abrahams concluded
The report focused on what it called a watershed in the conflict the attack by police forces on three ethnic Albanian villages in late February and early March in the Drenica region of central Kosovo
At least people including women and children were killed in the attack which involved helicopters artillery and armored personnel carriers
In the Yugoslav capital Belgrade which is a four hour drive north through rolling countryside from Kosovo s capital of Pristina Milosevic remains politically secure
That is in part his domestic critics say because diplomats like Holbrooke and the head of the UNrefugee agency Sadako Ogata insist on going to see him thus enhancing his stature
