The United States and its allies have waited four months while he cleaned the clock of the Kosovo Liberation Army said Morton Abramowitz head of the International Crisis Group a policy analysis organization and taken three weeks to discuss military action with the result that Albanian villages were destroyed Administration officials now acknowledge that when NATO failed to live up to its earlier threat in June to strike Serbia Milosevic took advantage of the indecision and plunged ahead with an artillery and tank offensive against the lightly armed guerrilla forces whose bedrock of popular support had helped win them effective control of large swaths of Kosovo territory including key roads$8
