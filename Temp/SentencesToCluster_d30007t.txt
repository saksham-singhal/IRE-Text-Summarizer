Rebel commanders said Tuesday they were poised to overrun an important government held air base in eastern Congo a battle that could determine the future of the two month Congolese war
After trekking several hundred kilometers miles through dense tropical forest thousands of rebel fighters have gathered kilometers miles outside Kindu where troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila have used an air base as a launching pad for offensives
If the rebels succeed in capturing Kindu kilometers miles west of Goma the rebel headquarters this will remove the last government stronghold in eastern Congo and pave the way for rebel advance into the mineral rich southwest
A rebel defeat on the other hand would put the coalition of ethnic Tutsis disenchanted members of the Congolese army and opposition politicians on the defensive and give a boost to Kabila s efforts to fend off the rebellion launched Aug
Rebel commander Richard Mondo said troops had fired artillery rounds into Kindu Monday and early Tuesday sending the population fleeing out of town
Advance units had crossed the Lualaba River from the north and were meeting stiff resistance in the town he said
Since the assault on the town began at am GMT at least enemy soldiers were killed and taken prisoner Mondo said adding the number was expected to rise
The rebels took casualties too but the number was not known
One rebel soldier was wounded in the stomach he said
He said the large Kindu air base kilometers miles outside town was deserted and no one appeared to be in control
Our soldiers are in the town and the fighting is continuing rebel battalion commander Arthur Mulunda said in Kalima kilometers miles northeast of Kindu
There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims
On Sunday a spokesman in Goma boasted that Kindu was already under rebel control
In Kinshasa government spokesman Didier Mumengi said Monday the Congolese army was firmly in control of Kindu
Mulunda s strong battalion walked kilometers miles Bukavu at the southern end of Lake Kivu to Kalima which fell to the rebels Saturday with little resistance
The rebel fighters clad in brand new Rwandan made dark green uniforms rubber rain boots and toting Kalashnikov assault rifles and rocket propelled grenade launchers said they were advancing slowly through the lush forest of palm trees and razor sharp tall grass
We ve been resting a lot
It took us two weeks to get here Mondo said
The rebels are now using Kalima a town with one main street scattered houses and mud and brick huts to supply troops with rice cooking oil drinking water and ammunition
A small grass airstrip kilometers miles away from Kalima is just barely long enough for the rebels Russian built Antonov AN transport aircraft
The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August when they were forced to retreat from the outskirts of Kinshasa after Angola and Zimbabwe sent troops to bail out Kabila
Rebels still control a string of towns in eastern Congo including Kisangani the country s third largest city
After a day of fighting Congolese rebels said Sunday they had entered Kindu the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by the government to halt their advances
Etienne Ngangura a rebel spokesman said the rebel fighters were inside Kindu and had taken the adjacent large airbase kilometers miles west of Goma the rebel stronghold
We re in the town and the airport Ngangura said
He offered no details and the report could not be confirmed independently
Rebel military sources said the fighting continued inside Kindu where the rebels were apparently meeting stiff resistance
The rebels ethnic Tutsis disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila s army and opposition politicians took up arms Aug
accusing Kabila of mismanagement corruption and creating division among Congo s tribes
The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August when they were forced to retreat from the outskirts of the capital Kinshasa after troops from Angola and Zimbabwe came to Kabila s aid
Troops moving south from Kisangani the largest city under rebel control and moving west had made steady gains against Kindu which the government apparently used to build up force for a planned counter offensive
Apart from Kindu Ngangura said rebel fighters took Buta kilometers miles north of Kisangani and on the main road in northern Congo that links Sudan and the Central African Republic
Also on Sunday Ngangura said the rebels took Bumba kilometers miles northwest of Kisangani
These reports could not be confirmed independently either
Rebel leaders said a victory at Kindu would confirm rebel strength boost fighters morale and perhaps persuade others to join them
The rebels want direct negotiations with Kabila
But the president has so far refused accusing the rebels of being puppets of Rwanda and Uganda which Kabila has accused of orchestrating the rebellion
The conflict in Central Africa has drawn in most of Congo s nine neighbors and regional diplomatic initiatives have so far failed to stop it
A day after shooting down a jetliner Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies pushed Sunday through government defense lines showing the confidence of a victor in a week old battle for a strategic air base
Fighting in Kindu kilometers miles northeast of the Elila River bridge died down after the rebels fired a barrage of artillery into the government held quarters and the air base four kilometers two miles away
Rebel commander Fino Kabangu Kalunga said the government forces surrounded by rebel troops from three directions failed to respond to Sunday s attacks
Some troops reportedly retreated through a single road corridor leading out of the town
On Saturday the rebels said they shot down a Congolese Boeing which was attempting to land at Kindu air base with troops and ammunition
In Kinshasa the private Congolese Airlines which owned the aircraft said the victims were civilians fleeing fighting in Kindu
It was not possible to confirm independently either claim
Kalunga said the airport although still under government control was in effect unoperational because of the rebel surface to air missiles deployed nearby
War weary physically exhausted and sweaty hundreds of rebel troops and Rwandan soldiers marched through dense tropical forest went to reinforce their comrades at Kindu
After a week of battling for Kindu rebel fighters had made little progress and failed to capture the town outright
The rebels see Kindu as a major prize in their two month revolt against President Laurent Kabila whom they accuse of mismanagement corruption and warmongering among Congo s tribes
Kabila has turned Kindu into a launching pad for a counteroffensive against rebel positions in eastern Congo
The conflict has drawn in many of Congo s neighbors
There are unconfirmed reports that troops from Chad and the Sudan are involved in defending Kindu
Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda former allies who installed him in power in May after an eight month rebellion of sponsoring the new fighting
Both countries say they have legitimate security interests in eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels
Tanks aircraft and troops from Angola Zimbabwe and Namibia are supporting Kabila
The assistance was essential in routing an early rebel offensive in the west that had reached the outskirts of Kinshasa in mid August
The rebels say they now control one third of Kindu and are poised to overrun the rest of the town
Under a scorching sun the column of rebel reinforcements heading to Kindu sneaked through abandoned roadside hamlets
The silence of their march was interrupted only by the singing of crickets and the clanging of the bullet belts hanging around the soldiers necks
Soldiers walked by empty huts made of mud and palm leaves
Some rested in the shade of the umbrella shaped acacia trees
The soldiers stopped for the night at the bridge over the chocolate colored Elila River which guards the path to Kindu
There was no immediate comment on the latest developments from the government in Kinshasa which claimed earlier in the week it was in control of the tarmac bridge
Back in the golden years Kasuku wa Ngeyo had a farm and was the head of a strong farmers organization in the northeastern breadbasket of this central African nation
A quarter of a century later the year old businessman who also ran hotels and a tourist camp is broke the farmers group is a memory
Inter tribal rivalry looting soldiers Rwandan refugees and two rebellions in as many years have wiped out half a million head of cattle here slashed coffee and tea exports in half and turned Congo s bucolic eastern region of green pastures sparkling volcanic lakes and snow capped mountains into a war zone
Nobody is making money any more
People are surviving on a sack of beans
They are tired of insecurity and have little hope things will get better said Kasuku the son of an Italian settler and a Rwandan Tutsi refugee mother
On Aug
Tutsis political opponents and disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila s army took up arms accusing Kabila of corruption nepotism and fostering tribal strife
The war has split Africa s third largest nation between the government held west and south and rebel controlled east and no political settlement is in sight
Goma a small trading post at the head of Lake Kivu in eastern Congo is no longer the starting point for tourists trekking to see mountain gorillas
Today its decaying buildings empty shops and crumbling guest houses are home to rebel leaders soldiers and people displaced by violence
The rebels have promised to revitalize the economy by reducing taxes to boost investment
They also say they will pay civil servants who haven t seen a paycheck in months or years and invite investors to buy tea and coffee farms and gold and diamond mining concessions
But the war has also increased tribal animosity especially toward ethnic Tutsis a tiny but highly successful minority in the eastern region
In the liberating effect of early political freedoms revived unresolved land disputes and led to clashes between the Rwandan Tutsis and Hutus who had settled in eastern Congo since the s
Mai Mai warriors armed youths from the Hunde and Nande tribes who accuse Tutsis of stealing their land also joined the fighting
In nearly million Rwandan refugees engulfed Goma a town of 
Among them were former Hutu soldiers and militiamen who took part in a genocide in neighboring Rwanda in which more than half a million Tutsis were killed
They brought anti Tutsi ideology with them and sold weapons to Congolese tribes who then joined in the persecution of Tutsi landowners and ranchers
People misunderstood political freedoms for anarchy said Safari Ngezayo a farmer and hotel owner
We tried to mediate between Tutsis and Hutus and other tribes but how can you talk to people who have blood on their hands and genocide in their heads In late Congolese Tutsis backed by Rwanda attacked the refugee camps dislodged the Hutu fighters and forced most of the refugees back home across the border
After an eight month rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda dictator Mobutu Sese Seko fled in May and Kabila took power
He quickly changed the name of the country to Congo from Zaire
Few people in northeastern Congo expected another rebellion so soon
I blame our politicians
Then I blame the foreign powers who kept meddling in our affairs
It is they who supported Mobutu and Kabila and we are paying the interest Kasuku said
The bloody bandages of injured rebels trucked back to this rear base Wednesday offered evidence that the three day battle for the strategic air base at Kindu was not going well for those fighting to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila
It was impossible to say who had the upper hand in the battle for Kindu and its air base which government forces have been using to launch airstrikes on eastern towns and to assemble ground troops
Rebel commander Richard Mondo said shelling and ground attacks which began Monday continued on Wednesday
Mondo said he was expecting air shipments of munitions to bolster the rebel offensive
On Wednesday a truck unloaded a dozen wounded rebel fighters at Kalima a small town kilometers miles northeast of Kindu serving as a rear base for the attack
Sweaty and weary some limping and others bandaged they waited to be airlifted to a hospital in Goma the rebel stronghold kilometers miles east on the Rwandan border

In Kinshasa the Ministry of Defense said Tuesday that the Congolese Armed Forces known as the FAC had killed rebels in warding off the attacks
Kindu is effectively in the hands of the FAC which has now launched an offensive after defending its positions said a ministry statement broadcast on state run television
The civilians there are cooperating fully with the FAC as their counterparts did previously in Kinshasa the capital
Rebel leaders hope the capture of Kindu will boost morale and demonstrate can carry their two month rebellion into the rest of Congo Africa s third largest nation
The rebel victory would also open routes to Katanga and Eastern Kasai provinces rich in copper and diamonds
The rebels targeted Kindu since late August when they were forced to retreat their march from extreme western Congo to the outskirts of Kinshasa after Angola and Zimbabwe sent troops to bail out Kabila
Rebel commanders say their fighters face an estimated government troops apparently reinforced by Sudanese soldiers

Rebels attacked a village in western Uganda and killed six civilians before soldiers drove them off a military spokesman said Thursday
The attack occurred overnight Wednesday in the village of Chiondo near Kasese kilometers miles west of the capital Kampala said the spokesman who identified himself only as Lt
Majera
Majera said the attackers were believed to be rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces who operate from bases in the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains that straddle the Uganda Congolese border

Majera said the attackers avoided a nearby army post when they shot up the village
It was the gunfire that alerted the soldiers he said adding that they killed two of the assailants
