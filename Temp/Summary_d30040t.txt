Israel s government does not permit Israelis to use the Palestinian airport citing security reasons
The airport opening had been held up for two years because of disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over Israel s role in monitoring passengers and cargo
A Palestinian industrial park between Gaza and Israel is to open next month while Israeli Palestinian negotiations on a Palestinian seaport in Gaza are continuing
As part of the latest Mideast peace accord Israeli and Palestinian officials were to sign a protocol for the airport Friday and Palestinian negotiators said Gaza International Airport would open Sunday
