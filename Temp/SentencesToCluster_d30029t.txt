United States maxi Sayonara looks set to continue the foreign domination of line honors in Australia s famous Sydney to Hobart yacht race which starts Saturday
Sayonara raced by American computer billionaire Larry Ellison has only been beaten once since it was launched in and is aiming for its second win in the nautical mile bluewater classic
If the footer beats the local boats home into Hobart it will be third time in four years a foreign yacht has finished first
New Zealand Endeavour trumped the locals in Sayonara won in and German s Morning Glory set a race record of two days hours seven minutes and seconds the following year
Sayonara s rivals are expected to be last year s line honors winner Brindabella of Sydney and new Australian maxi Wild Thing
The contest for handicap honors appears more open but there are many who believe Sayonara could become the sixth yacht to do the line honors and handicap double
Ellison believes unforeseen damage is the only major barrier to victory
She is a much more modern boat than Brindabella if we don t break we should beat Brindabella we should beat anybody Ellison said
If we hold together we should win the race the question is if this boat comes through and pays us a favor we would just love to knock off the record Ellison says Sayonara can knock half a day off Morning Glory s record given the right conditions
Brindabella s captain and owner George Snow believes a new record is possible
I think the front boats will be very close all the way down which will be a great challenge said Snow
We are well set up we ve got the best crew we ve ever had and I think the boat is in great shape Snow added
The race is tipped to start Saturday under freshening north easters with the prospect of showers and a thunder storm before a southerly change of around knots later in the day
The southerly is expected to ease to knots over Sunday before swinging back to the north on Monday with a west to south westerly change expected to move through Tasmania and Bass Strait on Tuesday when the first yacht is anticipated to finish
Leading maxi yachts Brindabella Sayonara and Marchioness were locked in a three way duel down the New South Wales state coast Saturday as the Sydney to Hobart fleet faced deteriorating weather
All three maxis reported in at the same latitude during Saturday night s positioning report when they were about nautical miles south of Jervis Bay on the New South Wales south coast
American maxi Sayonara and Sydney boat Brindabella reported they were about kilometers miles offshore while Marchioness was a couple of miles further inshore
In fourth spot was Australian maxi Wild Thing
The three leaders covered nautical miles in the first hours of the race
Propelled for the most part by favorable northerly breezes the leaders rocketed along at an average speed of knots in the first part of the nautical mile race to Hobart on the island state of Tasmania
The fast early pace put the leaders well on schedule to eclipse Morning Glory s race record but that was before the far tougher conditions forecast for overnight Saturday night
Morning Glory a German maxi broke the year old race record two years ago arriving in Hobart days hours seven minutes and seconds after she left Sydney
While the annual event started in friendly and favorable northeasterly breezes the strong fleet reported cloudier conditions as it moved down the coast
The yachts were bracing for a tough night with thunderstorms predicted ahead of a west southwesterly change expected to lash the south coast by Sunday morning
Earlier a crowd of around people on the Sydney headlands and water witnessed the start of the annual blue water classic
Sayonara took the initial honors when she beat Brindabella though Sydney heads but the line honors winner drew level when the American maxi s spinnaker blew out and had to be replaced
A major search was under way in Bass Strait off Australia s southeast coast on Sunday night for an injured crewman swept overboard during the Sydney to Hobart yacht race
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority AMSA said it had alerted all shipping in the Strait as high winds and huge seas smash into the remnants of the boat fleet
The Australian Navy has sent a Sea King helicopter with night vision and heat seeking equipment to search the area and may send the frigate HMAS Newcastle into the area Monday morning morning from Sydney
An AMSA spokesman said they were alerted that the meter Sydney yacht Sword of Orion had been rolled in the heavy seas with several crewmen being injured including the unidentified man lost overboard
Another crewman has a broken leg
The yacht which has a crew of was halfway across Bass Strait heading towards Hobart capital of the island state of Tasmania and the finish line in the annual race
The ANSA spokesman said search conditions were atrocious Earlier as winds gusting to knots and seas of feet caused havoc to the fleet several rescues took place
A police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept overboard when the Victorian yacht Kingurra was rolled over in huge seas nautical miles south of Gabo Island
John Campbell an American was in the water for about minutes and was suffering from hypothermia when he was winched to safety by senior constable Barry Barclay who dropped into foot seas to secure Campbell
The Victorian state police Air Wing used an infra red night vision system to find Campbell and the Navy Sea King is using the same equipment to try to find the man lost from Sword of Orion
Another helicopter lifted the entire crew of from the dismasted VC Offshore Stand Aside
Several crew members were injured in the dismasting with one losing several fingers and another suffering head injuries
A total of yachts have been forced to retire from the nautical mile race many having been dismasted or suffering injuries to crew
Meanwhile American maxi Sayonara is narrowly ahead of last year s line winner Brindabella
Although the two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed they were still well inside the race record for the nautical mile race of days hours seven minutes and seconds set by German maxi Morning Glory in

The worst thing of the whole affair was that after we got into the life raft and became separated from the others the damned thing capsized twice on these great seas at night which is bloody frightening let me tell you Winning said
You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the next thing is you are upside down
I wouldn t want to have spent another night out there The first recorded death in the race which started in was in when a year old yachtsman was washed overboard from Yahoo and presumed drowned
